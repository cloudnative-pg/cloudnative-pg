# Contributing to CloudNativePG

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to the CloudNativePG project! ðŸ’–

To get started, here's some areas the project could really use some help with:

* Problems found while setting up the development environment
* Gaps in our documentation
* Bugs in our GitHub actions
* Promotion of PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with our operator

First, though, it is important that you read the
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The guidelines below are a starting point. We don't want to limit your
creativity, passion, and initiative. If you think there are other things 
you can contribute, please feel free to bring it up in a GitHub Issue, 
or open a Pull Request!

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* [Documentation](docs/README.md)
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions on [Slack](README.md#communications) or GitHub Discussions
* The [website](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg.github.io)
* Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts
* Advocacy at Events (let us know when your talk about CloudNativePG is accepted!)
* Release management

For development contributions, please refer to the separate section called
["Contributing to the source code"](contribute/README.md).

## External Contributors vs Maintainers

**External Contributors:** If you're contributing from outside the core team, please note that some instructions in our detailed development docs apply only to maintainers. See the [development contribution guide](contribute/README.md) for complete details, but note:

- **Issue Assignment**: Comment "I'd like to work on this" instead of self-assigning
- **Testing**: Run local unit tests and basic e2e tests (see [testing guide](contribute/e2e_testing_environment/README.md)); maintainers will handle comprehensive cloud-based E2E testing
- **Project Boards**: Maintainers will move tickets through project phases

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to drop a line in
our [Slack channel](README.md#communications), or start a new GitHub discussion.

## Raising Issues

When raising [Issues](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/issues), please specify the following:

* Setup details as specified in the Issue template
* A scenario where the issue occurred (with details on how to reproduce it)
* Errors and log messages that are displayed by the involved software
* Any other detail that might be useful

If you are trying to report a vulnerability, please refer to the
[security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Meetings

We extend a warm welcome to everyone to join any of our meetings.
For further details, please visit the
[CloudNativePG Community Meetings](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg#cloudnativepg-community-meetings) page.
