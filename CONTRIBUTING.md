# Contributing to CloudNativePG

Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our CloudNativePG project! 💖

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedbacks on areas of
our project that we need help with, including:

* Problems found while setting up the development environment
* Gaps in our documentation
* Bugs in our Github actions
* Promotion of PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with our operator

First, though, it is important that you read the [code of
conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The guidelines below are a starting point. We don't want to limit your
creativity, passion, and initiative. If you think there's a better way, please
feel free to bring it up in a Github discussion, or open a pull request. We're
certain there are always better ways to do things, we just need to start some
constructive dialogue!

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions on Slack or Github Discussions
* Web design
* Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts
* Events participation
* Release management

For development contributions, please refer to the separate section called
["Contributing to the source code"](contribute/README.md).

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to drop a line in
our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/cloudnativepg/shared_invite/zt-17culux7k-P_UsVOOR9teUYi4dGhDSBQ), or
start a new Github discussion.

## Raising Issues

When raising issues, please specify the following:

- Setup details as specified in the issue template
- A scenario where the issue occurred (with details on how to reproduce it)
- Errors and log messages that are displayed by the involved software
- Any other detail that might be useful

## Meetings

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invitation to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don’t have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You don’t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing
yourself is more than enough. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable
voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others’ ideas, and even sharing your
own ideas, and experiences.

At the moment, the only meeting we have is the bi-weekly meeting for developers.
When the community grows, we hope there'll be other meetings, more focused on
specific aspects/subprojects (e.g. website).
