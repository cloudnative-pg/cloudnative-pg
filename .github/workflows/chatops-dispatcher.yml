# This workflow adds support for custom "slash commands" in the CI/CD pipeline.
# It is triggered by comments made on pull requests.
#
# 1. If the comment starts with "/test"
#    it will trigger a 'slash-command-receiver' workflow, which in turn, will
#    trigger an execution of the E2E Test Suite.
#
# 2. If the comment starts with "/ok-to-merge", it will label the PR with
#    "ok to merge :ok_hand:"
#
# 3. If the comment starts with "/ready-to-test", it will label the PR with
#    "ready to test :elephant:" if the label was not already applied, or remove
#    the label if it was there already.
