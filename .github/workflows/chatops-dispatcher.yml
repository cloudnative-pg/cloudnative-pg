# This workflow is triggered by comments creation events in pull request. It is the entry point of slash command
# support like /test, /ok-to-merge, /ready-to-test.
#
# 1. If the comment starts with "/test"
#    It will trigger 'slash-command-receiver' workflow and finally trigger e2e test in specific scope with params,
#    in format of  '/test test_level=4 depth=main'
#
#          test_level: With what level and above, the e2e test will be run. e2e test cases is classified with 5 levels
#                       0 highest, 1 high, 2 medium, 3 low, 4 lowest.
#                       all test cases smaller or equals than the test level specified by 'test_level' will be run.
#          depth:  E2e test cases is grouped by depth too, the value for depths are:
#                        schedule
#                        main
#                        pull_request
#                        push
#                   'schedule' contains most test cases coverage,  and 'push' contains less test cases coverage.
#
# 2. If the comment starts with "/ok-to-merge", it will label the PR with "ok to merge :ok_hand:"
#
# 3. If the comment starts with "/ready-to-test", it will label the PR with "ready to test :elephant:" if the label
#    does not already exist or remove the label "ready to test :elephant:" if it already exists.
