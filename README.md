# Welcome to the CloudNativePG project!

**CloudNativePG** is an open source operator designed to manage
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) workloads on any supported Kubernetes
cluster running in private, public, hybrid, or multi-cloud environments.

CloudNativePG was originally built and sponsored by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com).

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is with the ["Quickstart"](docs/src/quickstart.md)
section in the documentation.

## Scope

The goal of CloudNativePG is to increase the adoption of PostgreSQL, one of the
most loved DBMS in traditional VM and bare metal environments, inside
Kubernetes, thus making the database an integral part of the development
process and CI/CD automated pipelines.

### Out of scope

PostgreSQL is our focus. Developing a cross database operator is beyond the
scope of this project.
