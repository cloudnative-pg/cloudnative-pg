# Adopters

Below you can find a list of organizations and users who have agreed to
tell the world that they are using PostgreSQL in Kubernetes with our
CloudNativePG operator in a production environment.

The goal of this list is to inspire others to do the same and to grow
this open source community and project.

Please add your organization to this list. It takes 5 minutes of your time,
but it means a lot to us.
