- Add `bootstrap` section to configure how to initiate a cluster: `initDB`
  or `fullRecovery`
- Introduce defaulting and validating webhooks
- Simplify configuration (convention over configuration)
- Constrain rolling upgrades to the same PostgreSQL major version
- End-to-end tests run on GKE, AKS and GKS
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes and minor improvements

Version 0.3.0 - 25 Sep 2020

- Support for PostgreSQL 13
- Remove `emptyDir` volume storage support
- Node maintenance support for PostgreSQL clusters with local storage through
  the `nodeMaintenanceWindow` parameter
- Improve PostgreSQL configuration management through the usage of a dictionary
  supporting default, required and fixed values
- Use MD5 as authentication method for inter-cluster communication, with
  automated password creation in a secret
- Remove need for "trust" authentication method
- `spec.postgresql.pg_hba` is now optional, defaulting to MD5 authentication
  required for communication between Pods and `peer` for in-Pod communication
- Remove "unusable" annotation support, now PVC can just be removed followed by
  a deletion of the corresponding Pod
- Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Update from an earlier version not supported

Version 0.2.0 - 11 Aug 2020

- PostgreSQL 10 and 11 are now supported, in addition to PostgreSQL 12
- Usage of UBI as base image of the operator (OpenShift support)
- New Backup and ScheduledBackup CRD, allowing users to take a physical backup
  of the cluster in an object store that complies with the S3 protocol (such as
  AWS S3, MinIO, MinIO Gateway)
- Support for WAL archiving to an object store that complies with the S3 protocol
- Improvements in the E2e tests infrastructure
- Bug fixes and minor improvements

Version 0.1.0 -  3 Apr 2020

- Reuse of existing persistent storage with Pods (required for rolling updates)
- Independence between operator container image and PostgreSQL container image
  (required by rolling updates) - this enables usage of Community PostgreSQL images
- Rolling updates for the update of the operator and the entire cluster
  to a new version of PostgreSQL, by updating all the replicas first;
  switchover can be entirely managed by Kubernetes once replicas have been
  updated (`unsupervised` option), or manually triggered by the user (`supervised` option)
- Check framework for update-in-progress of a Pod
- Improvements in cluster status information
- E2E tests for Kubernetes 1.18
- E2E performance tests for failover (< 5 seconds)
- Improvements in E2E tests for switchover
- Support for PostgreSQL's `cluster_name` GUC
- New documentation section `Exposing Postgres services`
- New documentation section `Security`

Version 0.0.1 -  5 Mar 2020

Prototype of PostgreSQL Operator with:

- PostgreSQL 12.2 container image
- Self-Healing capability, through:
    - failover of the primary instance, by promoting the most aligned replica
    - automated recreation of a replica
- Planned switchover of the primary instance, by promoting a selected replica
- Scale up/down capabilities
- Definition of an arbitrary number of instances (minimum 1 - one primary server)
- Definition of the *read-write* service, to connect your applications to the only primary server of the cluster
- Definition of the *read-only* service, to connect your applications to any of the instances for read workloads
- Support for Local Persistent Volumes with PVC templates
- Standard output logging of PostgreSQL error messages
