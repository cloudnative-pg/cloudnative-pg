## CloudNativePG - Show diffs from main for a release branch
##
## This is a helper script that prints the GitHub pull requests
## that are present in the trunk and not in this branch, and
## viceversa. It should be used to help maintainers spot any
## missed commit to be backported, while waiting for an automate
## procedure that issues PRs on all supported release branches.
## It also enables to compare the current branch with another
## one, by passing an optional parameter.
##
## You need to run this script from the release branch.
## The following example compares 1.16 branch with main:
##
##     git checkout release-1.16
##     ./hack/show-release-diffs.sh
##
## This example compares the current branch with 1.15:
##
##     ./hack/show-release-diffs.sh release-1.15
