// Package majorupgrade provides the logic for upgrading a PostgreSQL cluster
// to a new major version.
//
// The upgrade process consists of the following steps:
//
//  1. Delete all Pods in the cluster.
//  2. Create and initiate the major upgrade job.
//  3. Wait for the job to complete.
//  4. If the upgrade job completes successfully, start new Pods for the upgraded version.
//     Otherwise, stop and wait for input by the user.
