## Release procedure

The release happens from a release branch.
A release branch is of the form "release-X.Y", i.e. "release-1.16".

The first two numbers in the version we are releasing must match the
digits in the release branch.

### Initial verification

- Make sure release notes for the release have been updated
  in `docs/src/release_notes.md` and have been approved by
  the maintainers
- Make sure that the operator capability levels page has been
  updated in `docs/src/operator_capability_levels.md` and approved
  by the maintainers

### Release steps

The following steps assume version 1.16.0 as the one to be released. Alter the
instructions accordingly for your version.

1. Run `hack/release.sh 1.16.0`.
2. Approve the PR that is automatically generated
3. Merge the PR. Make sure that the commit message
   title is `Version tag to 1.16.0` without prefixes.
4. Wait until all [Github Actions](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/actions) finish.
