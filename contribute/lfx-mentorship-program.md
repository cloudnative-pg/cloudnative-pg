# LFX Mentorship Program

CloudNativePG, as a CNCF project, proudly supports the
[LFX Mentorship Program](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/)
by the Linux Foundation.

This page lists the accepted CloudNativePG mentorship projects and provides
resources for current mentees, prospective applicants, and contributors
interested in getting involved.

Each mentorship project spans **12 weeks** and is designed to be a **full-time
learning opportunity**, requiring significant commitment and dedication from
mentees.

*Note:* we use the
["LFX Mentorship" label](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22LFX%20Mentorship%22)
to classify issues and pull requests.

## Recommended Preparation

While each project has its own skill requirements, the program aims to deepen
mentees’ knowledge in the following areas:

- **Go programming**, with a focus on operator development
- **Kubernetes** and **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
- **Git** and **GitHub workflows**
- **CloudNativePG architecture and usage**
- **PostgreSQL fundamentals**

We encourage aspiring mentees to begin familiarising themselves with these
topics in preparation for upcoming application cycles.
