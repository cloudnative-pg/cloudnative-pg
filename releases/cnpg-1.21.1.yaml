                              software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                              Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent
                              might be missing and make the backup useless. By default,

                              On a standby, this means that it will wait only when

                                init container will have the following effect: this
                                init container will be continually restarted on exit
                                until all regular containers have terminated. Once

                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although

                                before proceeding to the next init container. Instead,
                                the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe

                            activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have
                            no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not

                            restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral
                            container causes the Pod to exceed its resource allocation.
                            \n To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers

                                    is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry.
                                    Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated
                                    name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too

                                    once the pod exists. Normally this should not

                                            compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified

                                            and dataSourceRef) will be set to the
                                            same value automatically if one of them
                                            is empty and the other is non-empty. When

                                            and must be empty. There are three important

                                            types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                            any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                            objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                            values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an
                                            error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                            dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
