                      the PostgreSQL server. If set to true, an immediate checkpoint will be

                      possible. `false` by default.

                      If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed,
                      without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                      This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                      Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                      By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                      enabled.
                      On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                      If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                      an immediate segment switch.

                              the PostgreSQL server. If set to true, an immediate checkpoint will be
                              used, meaning PostgreSQL will complete the checkpoint as soon as
                              possible. `false` by default.

                              If false, the function will return immediately after the backup is completed,
                              without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                              This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                              Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                              By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                              enabled.
                              On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                              If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                              an immediate segment switch.

                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array

                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally

                              If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.

                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.

                        MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which

                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                          of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                          traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                          the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                          be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                          routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                          features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                          within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                          a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                          when picking a node.

                          publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                          Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                          The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                          propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                          The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                          Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                          Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                          through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                          specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                          than a virtual IP.
                          "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                          routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                          (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                          as the clusterIP.
                          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                    Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                    The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                    a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                    Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                    If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                    value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                    Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                    the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                    This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                    Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                            removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                            Pod to exceed its resource allocation.


                            To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                            Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                          Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                          init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                          to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                          unique among all containers.
                          Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                          The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                          by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                          of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                          in a similar fashion.
                          Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                    preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                    container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                    PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                    container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                    period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                    or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                this init container will be continually restarted on
                                exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                completed.

                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                It's a required field.

                                WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                the spread constraint.
                                - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                  but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                  skew.
                                A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                Use this if:
                                a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                of an individual pod.


                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                more information.


                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                persistent volumes at the same time.
                              properties:

                                    Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                    The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                    owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                    pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                    `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                    entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                    is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                    will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                    volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                    the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                    meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                    owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                    this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                    manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                            provisioner.
                                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.
                                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                            in the corresponding VolumeAttributesClass. This has a different purpose than storageClassName,
                                            it can be changed after the claim is created. An empty string value means that no VolumeAttributesClass
                                            will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                            If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                            will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                            If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                            set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                            exists.

                      without waiting for WAL to be archived.
                      This behavior is only useful with backup software that independently monitors WAL archiving.
                      Otherwise, WAL required to make the backup consistent might be missing and make the backup useless.
                      By default, or when this parameter is true, pg_backup_stop will wait for WAL to be archived when archiving is
                      enabled.
                      On a standby, this means that it will wait only when archive_mode = always.
                      If write activity on the primary is low, it may be useful to run pg_switch_wal on the primary in order to trigger
                      an immediate segment switch.
