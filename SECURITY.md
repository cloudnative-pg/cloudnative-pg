## Reporting a Vulnerability

To make a report, send an email containing the details of the vulnerability to
security@cloudnative-pg.io (an alias to a private mailing list in Google Groups
containing just the maintainers of the project). Private disclosure of a potential
vulnerability is important. The maintainers will reply acknowledging the report,
and decide whether to keep it private or publicly disclose it.

CloudNativePG relies on the
[GitHub infrastructure to manage security advisories and manage vulnerabilities](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/security).
