# Postgres instance manager

CloudNativePG does not rely on an external tool for failover management.
It simply relies on the Kubernetes API server and a native key component called:
the **Postgres instance manager**.

The instance manager takes care of the entire lifecycle of the PostgreSQL
leading process (also known as `postmaster`).

When you create a new cluster, the operator makes a Pod per instance.
The field `.spec.instances` specifies how many instances to create.

Each Pod will start the instance manager as the parent process (PID 1) for the
main container, which in turn runs the PostgreSQL instance. During the lifetime
of the Pod, the instance manager acts as a backend to handle the [liveness and
readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-probes).

## Liveness and readiness probes

The liveness probe relies on `pg_isready`, while the readiness probe checks if
the database is up and able to accept connections using the superuser
credentials.
The readiness probe is positive when the Pod is ready to accept traffic.
The liveness probe controls when to restart the container.

> The two probes will report a failure if the probe command fails 3 times with a 10 seconds interval between each check.

For now, the operator doesn't configure a `startupProbe` on the Pods, since
startup probes have been introduced only in Kubernetes 1.17.

The liveness probe is used to detect if the PostgreSQL instance is in a
broken state and needs to be restarted. The value in `startDelay` is used
to delay the probe's execution, which is used to prevent an
instance with a long startup time from being restarted.

The number of seconds after the Pod has started before the liveness
probe starts working is expressed in the `.spec.startDelay` parameter,
which defaults to 30 seconds. The correct value for your cluster is
related to the time needed by PostgreSQL to start.

If `.spec.startDelay` is too low, the liveness probe will start working
before the PostgreSQL startup, and the Pod could be restarted
inappropriately.

## Shutdown control

When a Pod running Postgres is deleted, either manually or by Kubernetes
following a node drain operation, the kubelet will send a termination signal to the
instance manager, and the instance manager will take care of shutting down
PostgreSQL in an appropriate way.
The `.spec.smartStopDelay` and `.spec.stopDelay` options, expressed in seconds,
control the amount of time given to PostgreSQL to shut down. The values default
to 180 and 1800 seconds, respectively.

The shutdown procedure is composed of two steps:

1. The instance manager requests a **smart** shut down, disallowing any
new connection to PostgreSQL. This step will last for up to
`.spec.smartStopDelay` seconds.

2. If PostgreSQL is still up, the instance manager requests a **fast**
shut down, terminating any existing connection and exiting promptly.
If the instance is archiving and/or streaming WAL files, the process
will wait for up to the remaining time set in `.spec.stopDelay` to complete the
operation and then forcibly shut down. Such timeout is calculated using the
following formula: `max(stopDelay - smartStopDelay, 30)`.

!!! Important
    In order to avoid any data loss in the Postgres cluster, which impacts
    the database RPO, don't delete the Pod where the primary instance is running.
    In this case, perform a switchover to another instance first.

### Shutdown of the primary during a switchover

During a switchover, the shutdown procedure is slightly different from the
general case. Indeed, the operator requires the former primary to issue a
**fast** shut down before the selected new primary can be promoted,
in order to ensure that all the data are available on the new primary.

For this reason, the `.spec.switchoverDelay`, expressed in seconds, controls
the  time given to the former primary to shut down gracefully and archive all 
the WAL files. By default it is set to `3600` (1 hour).

!!! Warning
    The `.spec.switchoverDelay` option affects the RPO and RTO of your
    PostgreSQL database. Setting it to a low value, might favor RTO over RPO
    but lead to data loss at cluster level and/or backup level. On the contrary,
    setting it to a high value, might remove the risk of data loss while leaving
    the cluster without an active primary for a longer time during the switchover.

## Failover

In case of primary pod failure, the cluster will go into failover mode.
Please refer to the ["Failover" section](failover.md) for details.
