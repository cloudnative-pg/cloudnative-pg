# Before You Start

Before we get started, it is essential to go over some terminology that is
specific to Kubernetes and PostgreSQL.

| [Storage Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)                                     | A *storage class* allows an administrator to define the classes of storage in a cluster, including provisioner (such as AWS EBS), reclaim policies, mount options, volume expansion, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Persistent Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)                              | A *persistent volume* (PV) is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster that represents storage that has been either manually provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned by a *storage class* controller. A PV is associated with a pod using a *persistent volume claim* and its lifecycle is independent of any pod that uses it. Normally, a PV is a network volume, especially in the public cloud. A [*local persistent volume* (LPV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) is a persistent volume that exists only on the particular node where the pod that uses it is running. |
| [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) | A *persistent volume claim* (PVC) represents a request for storage, which might include size, access mode, or a particular storage class. Similar to how a pod consumes node resources, a PVC consumes the resources of a PV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)                        | A *namespace* is a logical and isolated subset of a Kubernetes cluster and can be seen as a *virtual cluster* within the wider physical cluster. Namespaces allow administrators to create separated environments based on projects, departments, teams, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)                                             | *Role Based Access Control* (RBAC), also known as *role-based security*, is a method used in computer systems security to restrict access to the network and resources of a system to authorized users only. Kubernetes has a native API to control roles at the namespace and cluster level and associate them with specific resources and individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)                      | A *custom resource definition* (CRD) is an extension of the Kubernetes API and allows developers to create new data types and objects, *called custom resources*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)                                       | An *operator* is a custom resource that automates those steps that are normally performed by a human operator when managing one or more applications or given services. An operator assists Kubernetes in making sure that the resource's defined state always matches the observed one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)                                                 | `kubectl` is the command-line tool used to manage a Kubernetes cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Cloud Native PostgreSQL requires Kubernetes 1.19 or higher.

## PostgreSQL terminology

| Resource  | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance | A Postgres server process running and listening on a pair "IP address(es)" and "TCP port" (usually 5432). |
| Primary | A PostgreSQL instance that can accept both read and write operations. |
| Replica | A PostgreSQL instance replicating from the only primary instance in a cluster and is kept updated by reading a stream of Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records. A replica is also known as *standby* or *secondary* server. PostgreSQL relies on physical streaming replication (async/sync) and file-based log shipping (async). |
| Hot Standby | PostgreSQL feature that allows a *replica* to accept read-only workloads. |
| Cluster | To be intended as High Availability (HA) Cluster: a set of PostgreSQL instances made up by a single primary and an optional arbitrary number of replicas. |
| Replica Cluster | A Cloud Native PostgreSQL `Cluster` that is in continuous recovery mode from a selected PostgreSQL cluster, normally residing outside the Kubernetes cluster. It is a feature that enables multi-cluster deployments in private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts. |
| Designated Primary | A PostgreSQL standby instance in a replica cluster that is in continuous recovery from another PostgreSQL cluster and that is designated to become primary in case the replica cluster becomes primary. |
| Superuser | In PostgreSQL a *superuser* is any role with both `LOGIN` and `SUPERUSER` privileges. For security reasons, Cloud Native PostgreSQL performs administrative tasks by connecting to the `postgres` database as the `postgres` user via `peer` authentication over the local Unix Domain Socket. |

## Cloud terminology

| Resource  | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Region | A *region* in the Cloud is an isolated and independent geographic area organized in *availability zones*. Zones within a region have very little round-trip network latency. |
| Zone | An *availability zone* in the Cloud (also known as *zone*) is an area in a region where resources can be deployed. Usually, an availability zone corresponds to a data center or an isolated building of the same data center. |

## What to do next

Now that you have familiarized with the terminology, you can decide to
[test Cloud Native PostgreSQL on your laptop using a local cluster](quickstart.md) before deploying the operator in your selected cloud environment.
