# Examples

The examples show configuration files for setting up
your PostgreSQL cluster.

!!! Important
    These examples are for demonstration and experimentation
    purposes. You can execute them on a personal Kubernetes cluster with Minikube
    or Kind, as described in [Quick start](quickstart.md).

    For a list of available options, see [API reference](cloudnative-pg.v1.md).

## Pooler configuration

**Pooler with custom service config**

## Logical replication via declarative Publication and Subscription objects

Two test manifests contain everything needed to set up logical replication:

**Source cluster with a publication**
: [`cluster-example-logical-source.yaml`](samples/cluster-example-logical-source.yaml)

Sets up a cluster, `cluster-example` with some tables created in the `app`
database, and, importantly, *adds replication to the app user*.
A publication is created for the cluster on the `app` database: note that the
publication will be reconciled only after the cluster's primary is up and
running.

**Destination cluster with a subscription**
: *Prerequisites*: The source cluster with publication, defined as above.
: [`cluster-example-logical-destination.yaml`](samples/cluster-example-logical-destination.yaml)

Sets up a cluster `cluster-example-dest` with:

- the source cluster defined in the `externalClusters` stanza. Note that it uses
  the `app` role to connect, which assumes the source cluster grants it
  `replication` privilege.
- a bootstrap import of microservice type, with `schemaOnly` enabled

A subscription is created on the destination cluster: note that the subscription
will be reconciled only after the destination cluster's primary is up and
running.

After both clusters have been reconciled, together with the publication and
subscription objects, you can verify that that tables in the source cluster,
and the data in them, have been replicated in the destination cluster

In addition, there are some standalone example manifests:

**A plain Publication targeting All Tables**
: *Prerequisites*: an existing cluster `cluster-example`.
: [`publication-example.yaml`](samples/publication-example.yaml)

**A Publication with a constrained publication target**
: *Prerequisites*: an existing cluster `cluster-example`.
: [`publication-example-objects.yaml`](samples/publication-example-objects.yaml)

**A plain Subscription**
: Prerequisites: an existing cluster `cluster-example` set up as source, with
    a publication `pub-all`. A cluster `cluster-example-dest` set up as a
    destination cluster, including the `externalClusters` stanza with
    connection parameters to the source cluster, including a role with
    replication privilege.
: [`subscription-example.yaml`](samples/subscription-example.yaml)

All the above manifests create publications or subscriptions on the `app`
database. The Database CRD offers a convenient way to create databases
declaratively. With it, logical replication could be set up for arbitrary
databases.
Which brings us to the next section.

## Declarative management of Postgres databases

**A plain Database**
: *Prerequisites*: an existing cluster `cluster-example`.
: [`database-example.yaml`](samples/database-example.yaml)

**A Database with ICU local specifications**
: *Prerequisites*: an existing cluster `cluster-example` running Postgres 16
  or more advanced.
: [`database-example-icu.yaml`](samples/database-example-icu.yaml)
