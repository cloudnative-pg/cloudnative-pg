# PostgreSQL Database Management

CloudNativePG simplifies PostgreSQL database provisioning by automatically
creating an application database named `app` by default. This default behavior
is explained in the ["Bootstrap an Empty Cluster"](bootstrap.md#bootstrap-an-empty-cluster-initdb)
section.

For more advanced use cases, CloudNativePG introduces **declarative database
management**, which empowers users to define and control the lifecycle of
PostgreSQL databases using the `Database` Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
This method seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, providing a scalable,
automated, and consistent approach to managing PostgreSQL databases.

---

## Key Concepts

### Scope of Management

!!! Important
    CloudNativePG manages **global objects** in PostgreSQL clusters, such as
    databases, roles, and tablespaces. However, it does **not** manage the content
    of databases (e.g., schemas and tables). For database content, specialized
    tools or the applications themselves should be used.

### Declarative `Database` Manifest

The following example demonstrates how a `Database` resource interacts with a
`Cluster`:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-example-one
spec:
  name: one
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
```

When applied, this manifest creates a `Database` object called
`cluster-example-one` requesting a database named `one`, owned by the `app`
role, in the `cluster-example` PostgreSQL cluster.

!!! Info
    Please refer to the [API reference](cloudnative-pg.v1.md#postgresql-cnpg-io-v1-DatabaseSpec)
    the full list of attributes you can define for each `Database` object.

### Required Fields in the `Database` Manifest

- `metadata.name`: Unique name of the Kubernetes object within its namespace.
- `spec.name`: Name of the database as it will appear in PostgreSQL.
- `spec.owner`: PostgreSQL role that owns the database.
- `spec.cluster.name`: Name of the target PostgreSQL cluster.

The `Database` object must reference a specific `Cluster`, determining where
the database will be created. It is managed by the cluster's primary instance,
ensuring the database is created or updated as needed.

!!! Info
    The distinction between `metadata.name` and `spec.name` allows multiple
    `Database` resources to reference databases with the same name across different
    CloudNativePG clusters in the same Kubernetes namespace.

## Reserved Database Names

PostgreSQL automatically creates databases such as `postgres`, `template0`, and
`template1`. These names are reserved and cannot be used for new `Database`
objects in CloudNativePG.

!!! Important
    Creating a `Database` with `spec.name` set to `postgres`, `template0`, or
    `template1` is not allowed.

## Reconciliation and Status

Once a `Database` object is reconciled successfully:

- `status.applied` will be set to `true`.
- `status.observedGeneration` will match the `metadata.generation` of the last
  applied configuration.

Example of a reconciled `Database` object:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  generation: 1
  name: cluster-example-one
spec:
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
  name: one
  owner: app
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  applied: true
```

If an error occurs during reconciliation, `status.applied` will be `false`, and
an error message will be included in the `status.message` field.

## Deleting a Database

CloudNativePG supports two methods for database deletion:

1. Using the `delete` reclaim policy
2. Declaratively setting the database's `ensure` field to `absent`

### Deleting via `delete` Reclaim Policy

The `databaseReclaimPolicy` field determines the behavior when a `Database`
object is deleted:

- `retain` (default): The database remains in PostgreSQL for manual management.
- `delete`: The database is automatically removed from PostgreSQL.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-example-two
spec:
  databaseReclaimPolicy: delete
  name: two
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
```

Deleting this `Database` object will automatically remove the `two` database
from the `cluster-example` cluster.

### Declaratively Setting `ensure: absent`

To remove a database, set the `ensure` field to `absent` like in the following
example:.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-example-database-to-drop
spec:
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
  name: database-to-drop
  owner: app
  ensure: absent
```

This manifest ensures that the `database-to-drop` database is removed from the
`cluster-example` cluster.

## Limitations and Caveats

### Renaming a database

While CloudNativePG adheres to PostgreSQLâ€™s
[CREATE DATABASE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) and
[ALTER DATABASE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterdatabase.html)
commands, **renaming databases is not supported**.
Attempting to modify `spec.name` in an existing `Database` object will result
in rejection by Kubernetes.

### Creating vs. Altering a Database

- For new databases, CloudNativePG uses the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
- For existing databases, `ALTER DATABASE` is used to apply changes.

It is important to note that there are some differences between these two
Postgres commands: in particular, the options accepted by `ALTER` are a subset
of those accepted by `CREATE`.

!!! Warning
    Some fields, such as encoding and collation settings, are immutable in
    PostgreSQL. Attempts to modify these fields on existing databases will be
    ignored.

### Replica Clusters

Database objects declared on replica clusters cannot be enforced, as replicas
lack write privileges. These objects will remain in a pending state until the
replica is promoted.

### Conflict Resolution

If two `Database` objects in the same namespace manage the same PostgreSQL
database (i.e., identical `spec.name` and `spec.cluster.name`), the second
object will be rejected.

Example status message:

```yaml
status:
  applied: false
  message: 'reconciliation error: database "one" is already managed by Database object "cluster-example-one"'
```

### Postgres Version Differences

CloudNativePG adheres to PostgreSQL's capabilities. For example, features like
`ICU_RULES` introduced in PostgreSQL 16 are unavailable in earlier versions.
Errors from PostgreSQL will be reflected in the `Database` object's `status`.

### Manual Changes

CloudNativePG does not overwrite manual changes to databases. Once reconciled,
a `Database` object will not be reapplied unless its `metadata.generation`
changes, giving flexibility for direct PostgreSQL modifications.
