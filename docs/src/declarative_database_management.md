# Declarative Database Management

Declarative database management allows users to define and control the
lifecycle of PostgreSQL databases using the `Database` Custom Resource
Definition (CRD). This method integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, enabling a
consistent and automated approach to database management.

!!! Important
    Each `Database` resource must reference a specific `Cluster`, which
    determines where the database will be created.

The following example demonstrates how a `Database` resource interacts with a
`Cluster`:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: db-one
spec:
  name: one
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
```

When applied, this manifest requests the creation of a PostgreSQL database
named `one`, owned by the `app` role, within the `cluster-example` PostgreSQL
cluster. The `db-one` `Database` resource will reside in the Kubernetes
`default` namespace, where the corresponding `cluster-example` `Cluster`
resource must also exist.

In summary, the key options in the `Database` manifest are:

- `metadata.name`: the unique name of the Kubernetes object within its namespace.
- `spec.name`: the name of the database as it will appear in PostgreSQL.
- `owner`: the PostgreSQL role that owns the database.
- `cluster.name`: the name of the target PostgreSQL cluster.

The `Database` object is managed by the instance manager running on the primary
instance of the cluster, ensuring the database is created or updated as needed.

!!! Info
    The distinction between `metadata.name` and `spec.name` allows multiple
    `Database` resources with identical PostgreSQL database names to coexist in
    different CloudNativePG clusters within the same Kubernetes namespace.

!!! Warning
    While CloudNativePG adheres to PostgreSQLâ€™s
    [CREATE DATABASE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) and
    [ALTER DATABASE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterdatabase.html)
    commands, **renaming databases is not supported**. Attempting to modify
    `spec.name` in an existing `Database` object will result in rejection by
    Kubernetes.

## Managing an existing database via a Database manifest

It is possible to declare a Database object that references an existing
database. In such case, the Database's fields will be applied using `ALTER`
statements, rather than `CREATE`. There are differences between these two
Postgres commands. In particular, the options accepted by `ALTER` are a subset
of those accepted by `CREATE`.

The database reconciler will transparently handle this on behalf of the user,
making it easy to honor a Database manifest no matter the previous history
of the cluster.

There is however a difference regarding the handling of "immutable" fields: on
an existing Database object, any modification of the immutable fields will
be rejected at the Kubernetes level.
On a newly declared Database manifest that references an existing database, the
immutable fields will simply be ignored, as they are not valid options in the
`ALTER DATABASE` command.

!!! Warning
    If a Database manifest references an existing database, any fields in the
    manifest that cannot be set in `ALTER DATABASE` will be ignored.
    Notably, the options around encoding and collations, as well as the template
    used, are immutable and not supported in `ALTER`.

## Database objects defined on  replica clusters

Database objects declared on a replica cluster cannot be enforced, since the
replica does not have write privileges.
Instead, a Database object defined on a replica cluster will be periodically
re-queued, and will be enforced once the cluster is promoted.

## Reserved names

PostgreSQL creates the `postgres` database, as well as `template0` and
`template1`. Those names are therefore reserved for Postgres use. You will not
be allowed to create a Database with any of `postgres`, `template0`, or
`template1` as the `spec.name`.

## Status sub-resource

Once the reconciliation of a Database has been performed,
the Database status will be updated with the field  `applied` set to `true`,
and the field `observedGeneration` set to the last applied `generation`.
If there were errors during the reconciliation of a database, the `applied`
field would show `false`, and an additional field `message` would be displayed
in the status.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  [... snipped ...]
  generation: 1
  name: db-one
spec:
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
  name: declarative
  owner: app
  template: template0
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  applied: true
```

## Database Deletion and Reclaim Policies

A finalizer named `cnpg.io/deleteDatabase` is automatically added
to each Database object to control its deletion process.

By default, the `databaseReclaimPolicy` is set to `retain`, which means
that if the Database object is deleted, the underlying PostgreSQL database
will be retained for manual management by an administrator.

Alternatively, if the `databaseReclaimPolicy` is set to `delete`,
the PostgreSQL database will be automatically deleted when the Database
object is removed.

### Example: Database with Delete Reclaim Policy

The following example illustrates a Database object with a `delete`
reclaim policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: db-one-with-delete-reclaim-policy
spec:
  databaseReclaimPolicy: delete
  name: two
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
```

In this case, when the Database object is deleted, the database `two` will
be removed automatically in PostgreSQL.

## Imperative deletion of a PostgreSQL database

In the previous section, the database Reclaim Policy was discussed, which
determines whether the Postgres database should be dropped once the Database
object is deleted.

It is also possible to use the `ensure` field to delete an existing Postgres
database via a Database declaration. The default value of `ensure` is `present`.
Setting it to `absent` will have the effect of dropping the database in the next
reconciliation cycle.

### Example deletion of a Postgres database

In the following example, `ensure: absent` has the effect of dropping the
Postgres database. Since `applied` is true, we know the database was
successfully dropped.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  [... snipped ...]
  generation: 1
  name: db-one-deleter
spec:
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
  name: database-to-drop
  owner: app
  ensure: absent
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  applied: true
```

## Collision of Database objects

As mentioned above, the Database CRD has the fields `metadata.name` and
`spec.name`, which are individually settable. A situation can arise where two
Database objects refer to the same Postgres database (i.e. they have
identical `spec.name` and `spec.cluster.name`).

The database reconciler could simply apply them both. The first applied would
result in `CREATE` statements (assuming the database did not exist in Postgres),
while the second one would result in `ALTER` statements.
While this could work, it would make it much harder to reason about Database
objects. There would be uncertainty as to the order of operations.

For this reason, the database reconciler will check, given a Database object,
if there is already another Database object managing the same database.
If so, it will update its status with a message explaining this, and will not
apply any changes in Postgres, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  [... snipped ...]
  generation: 1
  name: db-duplicate
spec:
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
  name: declarative
  owner: app
status:
  applied: false
  message: 'reconciliation error: database "declarative" is already managed by Database object "db-one"'
```

!!! Warning
    A Database object referring to a Postgres database that is already being
    managed by a Database object will be rejected.

## Support of different Postgres versions

The DDL for databases in Postgres keeps evolving. For example, the option
[`ICU_RULES`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createdatabase.html) has
been introduced with Postgres 16 and is not available in previous versions.

The database reconciler will apply all the fields declared in the `spec`, and
will transparently relay back any error messages from Postgres, leaving it to
the user to take appropriate steps.

For example, applying the following Database manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
  kind: Database
  metadata:
    name: db-icu
spec:
  name: declarative-icu
  owner: app
  encoding: UTF8
  locale_provider: icu
  icu_locale: en
  icu_rules: fr
  template: template0
  cluster:
    name: cluster-example
```

on a cluster running Postgres 14 will result in an error message in the
Database object's status:

```yaml
[...]
status:
  applied: false
  error: 'reconciliation error: while creating database "declarative-icu": ERROR:
    option "locale_provider" not recognized (SQLSTATE 42601)'
```

This is exactly what would happen if you attempted to create the database
directly using `psql`. The database reconciler aims for transparency.

## Making direct changes in Postgres

It is possible to make changes directly in Postgres to a database that was
created or managed with a Database object.

The fields `observedGeneration` and `generation` described above will ensure
that once a Database has been reconciled to its defined `generation`, it will
not be re-applied by the instance manager. Therefore, your manual changes will
not be rolled back inadvertently.

CloudNativePG gives you the flexibility to make your databases via Database
manifests, via direct changes, or mixing matching to fit your use case.
