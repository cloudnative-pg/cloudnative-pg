# Cloud Native PostgreSQL Plugin

Cloud Native PostgreSQL provides a plugin for `kubectl` to manage a cluster in Kubernetes.
The plugin also works with `oc` in an OpenShift environment.

## Install

You can install the plugin in your system with:

```sh
curl -sSfL \
  https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/raw/main/install.sh | \
  sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Supported Architectures

Cloud Native PostgreSQL Plugin is currently build for the following operating system and architectures:

* Linux
  * amd64
  * arm 5/6/7
  * arm64
  * s390x
  * ppc64le
* macOS
  * amd64
  * arm64
* Windows
  * 386
  * amd64
  * arm 5/6/7
  * arm64


## Use

Once the plugin was installed and deployed, you can start using it like this:

```shell
kubectl cnp <command> <args...>
```

### Status

The `status` command provides an overview of the current status of your
cluster, including:

- **general information**: name of the cluster, PostgreSQL's system ID, number of
  instances, current timeline and position in the WAL
- **backup**: point of recoverability, and WAL archiving status as returned by
  the `pg_stat_archiver` view from the primary - or designated primary in the
  case of a replica cluster
- **streaming replication**: information taken directly from the `pg_stat_replication`
  view on the primary instance
- **instances**: information about each Postgres instance, taken directly by each
  instance manager; in the case of a standby, the `Current LSN` field corresponds
  to the latest write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery
  (replay LSN).

!!! Important
    The status information above is taken at different times and at different
    locations, resulting in slightly inconsistent returned values. For example,
    the `Current Write LSN` location in the main header, might be different
    from the `Current LSN` field in the instances status as it is taken at
    two different time intervals.

```shell
kubectl cnp status sandbox
```

```

The command also supports output in `yaml` and `json` format.

### Promote

The meaning of this command is to `promote` a pod in the cluster to primary, so you
can start with maintenance work or test a switch-over situation in your cluster

```shell
kubectl cnp promote cluster-example cluster-example-2
```
Or you can use the instance node number to promote
```shell
kubectl cnp promote cluster-example 2
```

### Certificates

Clusters created using the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator work with a CA to sign
a TLS authentication certificate.

To get a certificate, you need to provide a name for the secret to store
the credentials, the cluster name, and a user for this certificate

```shell
kubectl cnp certificate cluster-cert --cnp-cluster cluster-example --cnp-user appuser
```

After the secrete it's created, you can get it using `kubectl`

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert
```

And the content of the same in plain text using the following commands:

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert -o json | jq -r '.data | map(@base64d) | .[]'
```

### Restart

The `kubectl cnp restart` command requests the operator to orchestrate
a rollout restart for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply
configuration changes to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps
containing custom monitoring queries.

The following command will restart a given cluster in a rollout fashion:

```shell
kubectl cnp restart [cluster_name]
```

!!! Note
    If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be **automatically** reloaded by instances, you can
    add a label with key `k8s.enterprisedb.io/reload` to it.

### Reload

The `kubectl cnp reload` command requests the operator to trigger a reconciliation
loop for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply configuration changes
to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps containing custom monitoring queries.

The following command will reload all configurations for a given cluster:

```shell
kubectl cnp reload [cluster_name]
```
