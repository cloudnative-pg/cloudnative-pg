# CNPG-I
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0 -->

The **CloudNativePG Interface** ([CNPG-I](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cnpg-i))
is a standard way to extend and customize CloudNativePG without modifying its
core codebase.

## Why CNPG-I?

CloudNativePG supports a wide range of use cases, but sometimes its built-in
functionality isn’t enough, or adding certain features directly to the main
project isn’t practical.

Before CNPG-I, users had two main options:

- Fork the project to add custom behavior, or
- Extend the upstream codebase by writing custom components on top of it.

Both approaches created maintenance overhead, slowed upgrades, and delayed delivery of critical features.

CNPG-I solves these problems by providing a stable, gRPC-based integration
point for extending CloudNativePG at key points in a cluster’s lifecycle —such
as backups, recovery, and sub-resource reconciliation— without disrupting the
core project.

CNPG-I can extend:

- The operator, and/or
- The instance manager running inside PostgreSQL pods.

## Registering a plugin

CNPG-I is inspired by the Kubernetes
[Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/).
The operator communicates with registered plugins using **gRPC**, following the
[CNPG-I protocol](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cnpg-i/blob/main/docs/protocol.md).

CloudNativePG discovers plugins **at startup**. You can register them in one of two ways:

- Sidecar container – run the plugin inside the operator’s Deployment
- Standalone Deployment – run the plugin as a separate workload in the same
  namespace

In both cases, the plugin must be packaged as a container image.

### Sidecar Container

When running as a sidecar, the plugin must expose its gRPC server via a **Unix
domain socket**. This socket must be placed in a directory shared with the
operator container, mounted at the path set in `PLUGIN_SOCKET_DIR` (default:
`/plugin`).

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: controller-manager
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: cloudnative-pg:latest
        [...]
        name: manager
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /plugins
          name: cnpg-i-plugins
            
      - image: cnpg-i-plugin-example:latest
        name: cnpg-i-plugin-example
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /plugins
          name: cnpg-i-plugins
      volumes:
      - name: cnpg-i-plugins
        emptyDir: {}
```

### Standalone Deployment (recommended)

Running a plugin as its own Deployment decouples its lifecycle from the
operator’s and allows independent scaling. In this setup, the plugin exposes a
TCP gRPC endpoint behind a Service, with **mTLS** for secure communication.

!!! Warning
    CloudNativePG does **not** discover plugins dynamically. If you deploy a new
    plugin, you must **restart the operator** to detect it.

Example Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cnpg-i-plugin-example
spec:
  template:
    [...]
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cnpg-i-plugin-example
        image: cnpg-i-plugin-example:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090
          protocol: TCP
```

The related Service for the plugin must include:

- The label `cnpg.io/plugin: <plugin-name>` — required for CloudNativePG to
  discover the plugin
- The annotation `cnpg.io/pluginPort: <port>` — specifies the port where the
  plugin’s gRPC server is exposed

Example Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    cnpg.io/pluginPort: "9090"
  labels:
    cnpg.io/pluginName: cnpg-i-plugin-example.my-org.io
  name: cnpg-i-plugin-example
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9090
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9090
  selector:
    app: cnpg-i-plugin-example
```

### Configuring TLS Certificates

When a plugin runs as a `Deployment`, communication with CloudNativePG happens
over the network. To secure it, **mTLS is enforced**, requiring TLS
certificates for both sides.

Certificates must be stored as [Kubernetes TLS Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets)
and referenced in the plugin’s Service annotations
(`cnpg.io/pluginClientSecret` and `cnpg.io/pluginServerSecret`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    cnpg.io/pluginClientSecret: cnpg-i-plugin-example-client-tls
    cnpg.io/pluginServerSecret: cnpg-i-plugin-example-server-tls
    cnpg.io/pluginPort: "9090"
  name: barman-cloud
  namespace: postgresql-operator-system
spec:
    [...]
```

!!! Note
    You can provide your own certificate bundles, but the recommended method is
    to use [Cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io).

## Using a plugin

To enable a plugin, configure the `.spec.plugins` section in your `Cluster`
resource. Refer to the CloudNativePG API Reference for the full
[PluginConfiguration](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/docs/src/cloudnative-pg.v1.md#pluginconfiguration-----postgresql-cnpg-io-v1-pluginconfiguration)
specification.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-with-plugins
spec:
  instances: 1
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
  plugins:
  - name: cnpg-i-plugin-example.my-org.io
    enabled: true
    parameters:
      key1: value1
      key2: value2
```

Each plugin may have its own parameters—check the plugin’s documentation for
details. The `name` field in `spec.plugins` depends on how the plugin is
deployed:

- Sidecar container: use the Unix socket file name
- Deployment: use the value from the Service’s `cnpg.io/pluginName` label

## Community plugins

The CNPG-I protocol has quickly become a proven and reliable pattern for
extending CloudNativePG while keeping the core project maintainable.
Over time, the community has built and shared plugins that address real-world
needs and serve as examples for developers.
