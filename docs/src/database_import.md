# Importing Postgres databases

This section describes how to import one or more existing PostgreSQL
databases inside a brand new CloudNativePG cluster.

The import operation is based on the concept of online logical backups in PostgreSQL,
and relies on `pg_dump` via a network connection to the origin host, and `pg_restore`.
Thanks to native Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and snapshots,
PostgreSQL enables taking consistent backups over the network, in a concurrent
manner, without stopping any write activity.

Logical backups are also the most common, flexible and reliable technique to
perform major upgrades of PostgreSQL versions.

As a result, the instructions in this section are suitable for both:

- importing one or more databases from an existing PostgreSQL instance, even
  outside Kubernetes
- importing the database from any PostgreSQL version to one that is either the
  same or newer, enabling *major upgrades* of PostgreSQL (e.g. from version 11.x
  to version 15.x)

!!! Warning
    When performing major upgrades of PostgreSQL you are responsible for making
    sure that applications are compatible with the new version and that the
    upgrade path of the objects contained in the database (including extensions) is
    feasible.

In both cases, the operation is performed on a consistent **snapshot** of the
origin database.

!!! Important
    For this reason we suggest to stop write operations on the source before
    the final import in the `Cluster` resource, as changes done to the source
    database after the start of the backup will not be in the destination cluster -
    hence why this feature is referred to as "offline import" or "offline major
    upgrade".

## How it works

Conceptually, the import requires you to create a new cluster from scratch
(*destination cluster*), using the [`initdb` bootstrap method](bootstrap.md),
and then complete the `initdb.import` subsection to import objects from an
existing Postgres cluster (*source cluster*). As per PostgreSQL recommendation,
we suggest that the PostgreSQL major version of the *destination cluster* is
greater or equal than the one of the *source cluster*.

CloudNativePG provides two main ways to import objects from the source cluster
into the destination cluster:

- **microservice approach**: the destination cluster is designed to host a
  single application database owned by the specified application user, as
  recommended by the CloudNativePG project

- **monolith approach**: the destination cluster is designed to host multiple
  databases and different users, imported from the source cluster

The first import method is available via the `microservice` type, while the
latter by the `monolith` type.

!!! Warning
    It is your responsibility to ensure that the destination cluster can
    access the source cluster with a superuser or a user having enough
    privileges to take a logical backup with `pg_dump`. Please refer to the
    [PostgreSQL documentation on "SQL Dump"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html)
    for further information.

## The `microservice` type

With the microservice approach, you can specify a single database you want to
import from the source cluster into the destination cluster. The operation is
performed in 4 steps:

- `initdb` bootstrap of the new cluster
- export of the selected database (in `initdb.import.databases`) using
  `pg_dump -Fc`
- import of the database using `pg_restore --no-acl --no-owner` into the
  `initdb.database` (application database) owned by the `initdb.owner` user
- cleanup of the database dump file
- optional execution of the user defined SQL queries in the application
  database via the `postImportApplicationSQL` parameter
- execution of `ANALYZE VERBOSE` on the imported database

![Example of microservice import type](./images/microservice-import.png)

For example, the YAML below creates a new 3 instance PostgreSQL cluster (latest
available major version at the time the operator was released) called
`cluster-microservice` that imports the `angus` database from the
`cluster-pg96` cluster (with the unsupported PostgreSQL 9.6), by connecting to
the `postgres` database using the `postgres` user, via the password stored in
the `cluster-pg96-superuser` secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-microservice
spec:
  instances: 3

  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      import:
        type: microservice
        databases:
          - angus
        source:
          externalCluster: cluster-pg96
        #postImportApplicationSQL:
        #- |
        #  INSERT YOUR SQL QUERIES HERE
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
  externalClusters:
    - name: cluster-pg96
      connectionParameters:
        # Use the correct IP or host name for the source database
        host: pg96.local
        user: postgres
        dbname: postgres
      password:
        name: cluster-pg96-superuser
        key: password
```

!!! Warning
    The example above deliberately uses a source database running a version of
    PostgreSQL that is not supported anymore by the Community, and consequently by
    CloudNativePG.
    Data export from the source instance is performed using the version of
    `pg_dump` in the destination cluster, which must be a supported one, and
    equal or greater than the source one.
    Based on our experience, this way of exporting data should work on older
    and unsupported versions of Postgres too, giving you the chance to move your
    legacy data to a better system, inside Kubernetes.
    This is the main reason why we used 9.6 in the examples of this section.
    We'd be interested to hear from you should you experience any issues in this area.

There are a few things you need to be aware of when using the `microservice` type:

- It requires an `externalCluster` that points to an existing PostgreSQL
  instance containing the data to import (for more information, please refer to
  ["The `externalClusters` section"](bootstrap.md#the-externalclusters-section))
- Traffic must be allowed between the Kubernetes cluster and the
  `externalCluster` during the operation
- Connection to the source database must be granted with the specified user
  that needs to run `pg_dump` and read roles information (*superuser* is OK)
- Currently, the `pg_dump -Fc` result is stored temporarily inside the `dumps`
  folder in the `PGDATA` volume, so there should be enough available space to
  temporarily contain the dump result on the assigned node, as well as the
  restored data and indexes. Once the import operation is completed, this
  folder is automatically deleted by the operator.
- Only one database can be specified inside the `initdb.import.databases` array
- Roles are not imported - and as such they cannot be specified inside `initdb.import.roles`

## The `monolith` type

With the monolith approach, you can specify a set of roles and databases you
want to import from the source cluster into the destination cluster.
The operation is performed in the following steps:

- `initdb` bootstrap of the new cluster
- export and import of the selected roles
- export of the selected databases (in `initdb.import.databases`), one at a time,
  using `pg_dump -Fc`
- create each of the selected databases and import data using `pg_restore`
- run `ANALYZE` on each imported database
- cleanup of the database dump files

![Example of monolith import type](./images/monolith-import.png)

For example, the YAML below creates a new 3 instance PostgreSQL cluster (latest
available major version at the time the operator was released) called
`cluster-monolith` that imports the `accountant` and the `bank_user` roles,
as well as the `accounting`, `banking`, `resort` databases from the
`cluster-pg96` cluster (with the unsupported PostgreSQL 9.6), by connecting to
the `postgres` database using the `postgres` user, via the password stored in
the `cluster-pg96-superuser` secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-monolith
spec:
  instances: 3
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      import:
        type: monolith
        databases:
          - accounting
          - banking
          - resort
        roles:
          - accountant
          - bank_user
        source:
          externalCluster: cluster-pg96
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
  externalClusters:
    - name: cluster-pg96
      connectionParameters:
        # Use the correct IP or host name for the source database
        host: pg96.local
        user: postgres
        dbname: postgres
        sslmode: require
      password:
        name: cluster-pg96-superuser
        key: password
```

  restored data and indexes. Once the import operation is completed, this
  folder is automatically deleted by the operator.
- At least one database to be specified in the `initdb.import.databases` array
- Any role that is required by the imported databases must be specified inside
  `initdb.import.roles`, with the limitations below:
    - The following roles, if present, are not imported:
      `postgres`, `streaming_replica`, `cnp_pooler_pgbouncer`
    - The `SUPERUSER` option is removed from any imported role
- Wildcard `"*"` can be used as the only element in the `databases` and/or
  `roles` arrays to import every object of the kind; When matching databases
  the wildcard will ignore the `postgres` database, template databases,
  and those databases not allowing connections
- After the clone procedure is done, `ANALYZE VERBOSE` is executed for every
  database.
- `postImportApplicationSQL` field is not supported
