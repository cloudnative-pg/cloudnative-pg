# Kubectl Plugin

CloudNativePG provides a plugin for `kubectl` to manage a cluster in Kubernetes.

## Install

You can install the `cnpg` plugin using a variety of methods.

!!! Note
    For air-gapped systems, installation via package managers, using previously
    downloaded files, may be a good option.

### Via the installation script

```sh
curl -sSfL \
  https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/raw/main/hack/install-cnpg-plugin.sh | \
  sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using the Debian or RedHat packages

In the
[releases section of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/releases),
you can navigate to any release of interest (pick the same or newer release
than your CloudNativePG operator), and in it you will find an **Assets**
section. In that section are pre-built packages for a variety of systems.
As a result, you can follow standard practices and instructions to install
them in your systems.

#### Debian packages

For example, let's install the 1.22.2 release of the plugin, for an Intel based
64 bit server. First, we download the right `.deb` file.

``` sh
$ wget https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/releases/download/v1.22.1/kubectl-cnpg_1.22.2_linux_x86_64.deb
```

Then, install from the local file using `dpkg`:

``` sh
$ dpkg -i kubectl-cnpg_1.22.2_linux_x86_64.deb
(Reading database ... 702524 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack kubectl-cnpg_1.22.2_linux_x86_64.deb ...
Unpacking cnpg (1.22.2) over (1.22.2) ...
Setting up cnpg (1.22.2) ..
```

#### RPM packages

As in the example for `.deb` packages, let's install the 1.22.2 release for an
Intel 64 bit machine. Note the `--output` flag to provide a file name.

``` sh
curl -L https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/releases/download/v1.22.2/kubectl-cnpg_1.22.2_linux_x86_64.rpm \
  --output kube-plugin.rpm
```

Then install with `yum`, and you're ready to use:

``` sh
$ yum --disablerepo=* localinstall kube-plugin.rpm
yum --disablerepo=* localinstall kube-plugin.rpm    
Failed to set locale, defaulting to C.UTF-8
Dependencies resolved.

### Using Krew

If you already have [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) installed, you can simply
run:

```sh
kubectl krew install cnpg
```

When a new version of the plugin is released, you can update the existing
installation with:

```sh
kubectl krew update
kubectl krew upgrade cnpg
```

### Using Homebrew

!!! Note
    Please note that the Homebrew community manages the availability of the [kubectl-cnpg plugin on Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kubectl-cnpg).

If you already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can simply
run:

```sh
brew install kubectl-cnpg
```

When a new version of the plugin is released, you can update the existing
installation with:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade kubectl-cnpg
```

!!! Note
    Auto-completion for the kubectl plugin is already managed by Homebrew.
    There's no need to create the `kubectl_complete-cnpg` script mentioned below.

### Supported Architectures

CloudNativePG Plugin is currently built for the following
operating system and architectures:

* Linux
  * amd64
  * arm 5/6/7
  * arm64
  * s390x
  * ppc64le
* macOS
  * amd64
  * arm64
* Windows
  * 386
  * amd64
  * arm 5/6/7
  * arm64

### Configuring auto-completion

To configure auto-completion for the plugin, a helper shell script needs to be
installed into your current PATH. Assuming the latter contains `/usr/local/bin`,
this can be done with the following commands:

```shell
cat > kubectl_complete-cnpg <<EOF
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Call the __complete command passing it all arguments
kubectl cnpg __complete "\$@"
EOF

chmod +x kubectl_complete-cnpg

# Important: the following command may require superuser permission
sudo mv kubectl_complete-cnpg /usr/local/bin
```

!!! Important
    The name of the script needs to be exactly the one provided since is used by the kubectl auto-complete process

## Use

Once the plugin was installed and deployed, you can start using it like this:

```shell
kubectl cnpg <command> <args...>
```

### Generation of installation manifests

The `cnpg` plugin can be used to generate the YAML manifest for the
installation of the operator. This option would typically be used if you want
to override some default configurations such as number of replicas,
installation namespace, namespaces to watch, and so on.

For details and available options, run:

```shell
kubectl cnpg install generate --help
```

The main options are:

- `-n`: the namespace in which to install the operator (by default: `cnpg-system`)
- `--replicas`: number of replicas in the deployment
- `--version`: minor version of the operator to be installed, such as `1.17`.
  If a minor version is specified, the plugin will install the latest patch
  version of that minor version. If no version is supplied the plugin will
  install the latest `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version of the operator.
- `--watch-namespace`: comma separated string containing the namespaces to
  watch (by default all namespaces)

An example of the `generate` command, which will generate a YAML manifest that
will install the operator, is as follows:

```shell
kubectl cnpg install generate \
  -n king \
  --version 1.17 \
  --replicas 3 \
  --watch-namespace "albert, bb, freddie" \
  > operator.yaml
```

The flags in the above command have the following meaning:
- `-n king` install the CNPG operator into the `king` namespace
- `--version 1.17` install the latest patch version for minor version 1.17
- `--replicas 3` install the operator with 3 replicas
- `--watch-namespace "albert, bb, freddie"` have the operator watch for
  changes in the `albert`, `bb` and `freddie` namespaces only

### Status

The `status` command provides an overview of the current status of your
cluster, including:

* **general information**: name of the cluster, PostgreSQL's system ID, number of
  instances, current timeline and position in the WAL
* **backup**: point of recoverability, and WAL archiving status as returned by
  the `pg_stat_archiver` view from the primary - or designated primary in the
  case of a replica cluster
* **streaming replication**: information taken directly from the `pg_stat_replication`
  view on the primary instance
* **instances**: information about each Postgres instance, taken directly by each
  instance manager; in the case of a standby, the `Current LSN` field corresponds
  to the latest write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery
  (replay LSN).

!!! Important
    The status information above is taken at different times and at different
    locations, resulting in slightly inconsistent returned values. For example,
    the `Current Write LSN` location in the main header, might be different
    from the `Current LSN` field in the instances status as it is taken at
    two different time intervals.

```shell
kubectl cnpg status sandbox

```

The command also supports output in `yaml` and `json` format.

### Promote

The meaning of this command is to `promote` a pod in the cluster to primary, so you
can start with maintenance work or test a switch-over situation in your cluster

```shell
kubectl cnpg promote cluster-example cluster-example-2
```

Or you can use the instance node number to promote

```shell
kubectl cnpg promote cluster-example 2
```

### Certificates

Clusters created using the CloudNativePG operator work with a CA to sign
a TLS authentication certificate.

To get a certificate, you need to provide a name for the secret to store
the credentials, the cluster name, and a user for this certificate

```shell
kubectl cnpg certificate cluster-cert --cnpg-cluster cluster-example --cnpg-user appuser
```

After the secret it's created, you can get it using `kubectl`

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert
```

And the content of the same in plain text using the following commands:

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert -o json | jq -r '.data | map(@base64d) | .[]'
```

### Restart

The `kubectl cnpg restart` command can be used in two cases:

- requesting the operator to orchestrate a rollout restart
  for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply
  configuration changes to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps
  containing custom monitoring queries.

- request a single instance restart, either in-place if the instance is
  the cluster's primary or deleting and recreating the pod if
  it is a replica.

```shell
# this command will restart a whole cluster in a rollout fashion
kubectl cnpg restart [clusterName]

# this command will restart a single instance, according to the policy above
kubectl cnpg restart [clusterName] [pod]
```

If the in-place restart is requested but the change cannot be applied without
a switchover, the switchover will take precedence over the in-place restart. A
common case for this will be a minor upgrade of PostgreSQL image.

!!! Note
    If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be **automatically** reloaded
    by instances, you can add a label with key `cnpg.io/reload` to it.

### Reload

The `kubectl cnpg reload` command requests the operator to trigger a reconciliation
loop for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply configuration changes
to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps containing custom monitoring queries.

The following command will reload all configurations for a given cluster:

```shell
kubectl cnpg reload [cluster_name]
```

### Maintenance

The `kubectl cnpg maintenance` command helps to modify one or more clusters
across namespaces and set the maintenance window values, it will change
the following fields:

* .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.inProgress
* .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.reusePVC

Accepts as argument `set` and `unset` using this to set the
`inProgress` to `true` in case `set`and to `false` in case of `unset`.

By default, `reusePVC` is always set to `false` unless the `--reusePVC` flag is passed.

The plugin will ask for a confirmation with a list of the cluster to modify
and their new values, if this is accepted this action will be applied to
all the cluster in the list.

If you want to set in maintenance all the PostgreSQL in your Kubernetes cluster,
just need to write the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnpg maintenance set --all-namespaces
```

And you'll have the list of all the cluster to update

```shell
The following are the new values for the clusters
Namespace  Cluster Name     Maintenance  reusePVC
---------  ------------     -----------  --------
default    cluster-example  true         false
default    pg-backup        true         false
test       cluster-example  true         false
Do you want to proceed? [y/n]: y
```

### Report

The `kubectl cnpg report` command bundles various pieces
of information into a ZIP file.
It aims to provide the needed context to debug problems
with clusters in production.

It has two sub-commands: `operator` and `cluster`.

#### report Operator

The `operator` sub-command requests the operator to provide information
regarding the operator deployment, configuration and events.

!!! Important
    All confidential information in Secrets and ConfigMaps is REDACTED.
    The Data map will show the **keys** but the values will be empty.
    The flag `-S` / `--stopRedaction` will defeat the redaction and show the
    values. Use only at your own risk, this will share private data.

!!! Note
    By default, operator logs are not collected, but you can enable operator
    log collection with the `--logs` flag

* **deployment information**: the operator Deployment and operator Pod
* **configuration**: the Secrets and ConfigMaps in the operator namespace
* **events**: the Events in the operator namespace
* **webhook configuration**: the mutating and validating webhook configurations
* **webhook service**: the webhook service
* **logs**: logs for the operator Pod (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format

The command will generate a ZIP file containing various manifest in YAML format
(by default, but settable to JSON with the `-o` flag).
Use the `-f` flag to name a result file explicitly. If the `-f` flag is not used, a
default time-stamped filename is created for the zip file.

!!! Note
    The report plugin obeys `kubectl` conventions, and will look for objects constrained
    by namespace. The CNPG Operator will generally not be installed in the same
    namespace as the clusters.
    E.g. the default installation namespace is cnpg-system

```shell
kubectl cnpg report operator -n <namespace>
```

results in

```shell
Successfully written report to "report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

With the `-f` flag set:

```shell
kubectl cnpg report operator -n <namespace> -f reportRedacted.zip
```

Unzipping the file will produce a time-stamped top-level folder to keep the
directory tidy:

```shell
unzip reportRedacted.zip
```

will result in:

```shell
Archive:  reportRedacted.zip
   creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/
   creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/deployment.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/operator-pod.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/validating-webhook-configuration.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/webhook-service.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cnpg-ca-secret.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cnpg-webhook-cert.yaml
```

If you activated the `--logs` option, you'd see an extra subdirectory:

```shell
Archive:  report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
  <snipped …>
  creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/cnpg-controller-manager-66fb98dbc5-pxkmh-logs.jsonl
```

!!! Note
    The plugin will try to get the PREVIOUS operator's logs, which is helpful
    when investigating restarted operators.
    In all cases, it will also try to get the CURRENT operator logs. If current
    and previous logs are available, it will show them both.

``` json
====== Begin of Previous Log =====
2023-03-28T12:56:41.251711811Z {"level":"info","ts":"2023-03-28T12:56:41Z","logger":"setup","msg":"Starting CloudNativePG Operator","version":"1.19.1","build":{"Version":"1.19.0+dev107","Commit":"cc9bab17","Date":"2023-03-28"}}

====== End of Previous Log =====
2023-03-28T12:57:09.854306024Z {"level":"info","ts":"2023-03-28T12:57:09Z","logger":"setup","msg":"Starting CloudNativePG Operator","version":"1.19.1","build":{"Version":"1.19.0+dev107","Commit":"cc9bab17","Date":"2023-03-28"}}

```

If the operator hasn't been restarted, you'll still see the `====== Begin …`
and  `====== End …` guards, with no content inside.

You can verify that the confidential information is REDACTED by default:

```shell
cd report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
head cnpg-ca-secret.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  ca.crt: ""
  ca.key: ""
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-03-22T10:42:28Z"
  managedFields:
  - apiVersion: v1
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
    fieldsV1:
```

With the `-S` (`--stopRedaction`) option activated, secrets are shown:

```shell
kubectl cnpg report operator -n <namespace> -f reportNonRedacted.zip -S
```

You'll get a reminder that you're about to view confidential information:

```shell
WARNING: secret Redaction is OFF. Use it with caution
Successfully written report to "reportNonRedacted.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

```shell
unzip reportNonRedacted.zip
head cnpg-ca-secret.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  ca.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBD…
  ca.key: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBF…
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-03-22T10:42:28Z"
  managedFields:
  - apiVersion: v1
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
```

#### report Cluster

The `cluster` sub-command gathers the following:

* **cluster resources**: the cluster information, same as `kubectl get cluster -o yaml`
* **cluster pods**: pods in the cluster namespace matching the cluster name
* **cluster jobs**: jobs, if any, in the cluster namespace matching the cluster name
* **events**: events in the cluster namespace
* **pod logs**: logs for the cluster Pods (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format
* **job logs**: logs for the Pods created by jobs (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format

The `cluster` sub-command accepts the `-f` and `-o` flags, as the `operator` does.
If the `-f` flag is not used, a default timestamped report name will be used.
Note that the cluster information does not contain configuration Secrets / ConfigMaps,
so the `-S` is disabled.

!!! Note
    By default, cluster logs are not collected, but you can enable cluster
    log collection with the `--logs` flag

Usage:

```shell
kubectl cnpg report cluster <clusterName> [flags]
```

Note that, unlike the `operator` sub-command, for the `cluster` sub-command you
need to provide the cluster name, and very likely the namespace, unless the cluster
is in the default one.

```shell
kubectl cnpg report cluster example -f report.zip -n example_namespace
```

and then:

```shell
unzip report.zip
```

```shell
Archive:  report.zip
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-pods.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-jobs.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml
```

Remember that you can use the `--logs` flag to add the pod and job logs to the ZIP.

```shell
kubectl cnpg report cluster example -n example_namespace --logs
```

will result in:

```shell
Successfully written report to "report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

```shell
unzip report_cluster_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
```

```shell
Archive:  report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-pods.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/cluster-jobs.yaml
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/logs/
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/logs/cluster-example-full-1.jsonl
   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/cluster-example-full-1-initdb-qnnvw.jsonl
  inflating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/job-logs/cluster-example-full-2-join-tvj8r.jsonl
```

### Logs

The `kubectl cnpg logs` command allows to follow the logs of a collection
of pods related to CloudNativePG in a single go.

It has at the moment one available sub-command: `cluster`.

#### Cluster logs

The `cluster` sub-command gathers all the pod logs for a cluster in a single
stream or file.
This means that you can get all the pod logs in a single terminal window, with a
single invocation of the command.

As in all the cnpg plugin sub-commands, you can get instructions and help with
the `-h` flag:

`kubectl cnpg logs cluster -h`

The `logs` command will display logs in  JSON-lines format, unless the
`--timestamps` flag is used, in which case, a human readable timestamp will be
prepended to each line. In this case, lines will no longer be valid JSON,
and tools such as `jq` may not work as desired.

If the `logs cluster` sub-command is given the `-f` flag (aka `--follow`), it
will follow the cluster pod logs, and will also watch for any new pods created
in the cluster after the command has been invoked.
Any new pods found, including pods that have been restarted or re-created,
will also have their pods followed.
The logs will be displayed in the terminal's standard-out.
This command will only exit when the cluster has no more pods left, or when it
is interrupted by the user.

If `logs` is called without the `-f` option, it will read the logs from all
cluster pods until the time of invocation and display them in the terminal's
standard-out, then exit.
The `-o` or `--output` flag can be provided, to specify the name
of the file where the logs should be saved, instead of displaying over
standard-out.
The `--tail` flag can be used to specify how many log lines will be retrieved
from each pod in the cluster. By default, the `logs cluster` sub-command will
display all the logs from each pod in the cluster. If combined with the "follow"
flag `-f`, the number of logs specified by `--tail` will be retrieved until the
current time, and and from then the new logs will be followed.

NOTE: unlike other `cnpg` plugin commands, the `-f` is used to denote "follow"
rather than specify a file. This keeps with the convention of `kubectl logs`,
which takes `-f` to mean the logs should be followed.

Usage:

```shell
kubectl cnpg logs cluster <clusterName> [flags]
```

Using the `-f` option to follow:

```shell
kubectl cnpg report cluster cluster-example -f
```

Using `--tail` option to display 3 lines from each pod and the `-f` option
to follow:

```shell
kubectl cnpg report cluster cluster-example -f --tail 3
```

``` json
{"level":"info","ts":"2023-06-30T13:37:33Z","logger":"postgres","msg":"2023-06-30 13:37:33.142 UTC [26] LOG:  ending log output to stderr","source":"/controller/log/postgres","logging_pod":"cluster-example-3"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2023-06-30T13:37:33Z","logger":"postgres","msg":"2023-06-30 13:37:33.142 UTC [26] HINT:  Future log output will go to log destination \"csvlog\".","source":"/controller/log/postgres","logging_pod":"cluster-example-3"}
…
…
```

With the `-o` option omitted, and with `--output` specified:

``` sh
kubectl cnpg logs cluster cluster-example --output my-cluster.log

Successfully written logs to "my-cluster.log"
```

### Destroy

The `kubectl cnpg destroy` command helps remove an instance and all the
associated PVCs from a Kubernetes cluster.

The optional `--keep-pvc` flag, if specified, allows you to keep the PVCs,
while removing all `metadata.ownerReferences` that were set by the instance.
Additionally, the `cnpg.io/pvcStatus` label on the PVCs will change from
`ready` to `detached` to signify that they are no longer in use.

Running again the command without the `--keep-pvc` flag will remove the
detached PVCs.

Usage:

```
kubectl cnpg destroy [CLUSTER_NAME] [INSTANCE_ID]
```

The following example removes the `cluster-example-2` pod and the associated
PVCs:

```
kubectl cnpg destroy cluster-example 2
```

### Cluster hibernation

Sometimes you may want to suspend the execution of a CloudNativePG `Cluster`
while retaining its data, then resume its activity at a later time. We've
called this feature **cluster hibernation**.

Hibernation is only available via the `kubectl cnpg hibernate [on|off]`
commands.

Hibernating a CloudNativePG cluster means destroying all the resources
generated by the cluster, except the PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary
instance.

You can hibernate a cluster with:

```
kubectl cnpg hibernate on <cluster-name>
```

This will:

1. shutdown every PostgreSQL instance
2. detach the PVCs containing the data of the primary instance, and annotate
   them with the latest database status and the latest cluster configuration
3. delete the `Cluster` resource, including every generated resource - except
   the aforementioned PVCs

When hibernated, a CloudNativePG cluster is represented by just a group of
PVCs, in which the one containing the `PGDATA` is annotated with the latest
available status, including content from `pg_controldata`.

!!! Warning
    A cluster having fenced instances cannot be hibernated, as fencing is
    part of the hibernation procedure too.

In case of error the operator will not be able to revert the procedure. You can
still force the operation with:

```
kubectl cnpg hibernate on cluster-example --force
```

A hibernated cluster can be resumed with:

```
kubectl cnpg hibernate off <cluster-name>
```

Once the cluster has been hibernated, it's possible to show the last
configuration and the status that PostgreSQL had after it was shut down.
That can be done with:

```
kubectl cnpg hibernate status <cluster-name>
```

### Benchmarking the database with pgbench

Pgbench can be run against an existing PostgreSQL cluster with following
command:

```
kubectl cnpg pgbench <cluster-name> -- --time 30 --client 1 --jobs 1
```

Refer to the [Benchmarking pgbench section](benchmarking.md#pgbench) for more
details.

### Benchmarking the storage with fio

fio can be run on an existing storage class with following command:

```
kubectl cnpg fio <fio-job-name> -n <namespace>
```

Refer to the [Benchmarking fio section](benchmarking.md#fio) for more details.

### Requesting a new physical backup

The `kubectl cnpg backup` command requests a new physical backup for
an existing Postgres cluster by creating a new `Backup` resource.

!!! Info
    From release 1.21, the `backup` command accepts a new flag, `-m`
    to specify the backup method.
    To request a backup using volume snapshots, set `-m volumeSnapshot`

The following example requests an on-demand backup for a given cluster:

```shell
kubectl cnpg backup [cluster_name]
```

or, if using volume snapshots (from release 1.21)

```shell
kubectl cnpg backup [cluster_name] -m volumeSnapshot
```

The created backup will be named after the request time:

```shell
kubectl cnpg backup cluster-example
backup/cluster-example-20230121002300 created
```

By default, a newly created backup will use the backup target policy defined
in the cluster to choose which instance to run on.
However, you can override this policy with the `--backup-target` option.

In the case of volume snapshot backups, you can also use the `--online` option
to request an online/hot backup or an offline/cold one: additionally, you can
also tune online backups by explicitly setting the `--immediate-checkpoint` and
`--wait-for-archive` options.

The ["Backup" section](./backup.md#backup) contains more information about
the configuration settings.

### Launching psql

The `kubectl cnpg psql` command starts a new PostgreSQL interactive front-end
process (psql) connected to an existing Postgres cluster, as if you were running
it from the actual pod. This means that you will be using the `postgres` user.

!!! Important
    As you will be connecting as `postgres` user, in production environments this
    method should be used with extreme care, by authorized personnel only.

```shell
kubectl cnpg psql cluster-example

psql (16.3 (Debian 16.3-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

By default, the command will connect to the primary instance. The user can
select to work against a replica by using the `--replica` option:

```shell
kubectl cnpg psql --replica cluster-example
psql (16.3 (Debian 16.3-1.pgdg110+1))

Type "help" for help.

postgres=# select pg_is_in_recovery();
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 t
(1 row)

postgres=# \q
```

This command will start `kubectl exec`, and the `kubectl` executable must be
reachable in your `PATH` variable to correctly work.

### Snapshotting a Postgres cluster

!!! Warning
    The `kubectl cnpg snapshot` command has been removed.
    Please use the [`backup` command](#requesting-a-new-backup) to request
    backups using volume snapshots.

### Using pgAdmin4 for evaluation/demonstration purposes only

[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) stands as the most popular and feature-rich
open-source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL.
For more information on the project, please refer to the official
[documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/).

Given that the pgAdmin Development Team maintains official Docker container
images, you can install pgAdmin in your environment as a standard
Kubernetes deployment.

!!! Important
    Deployment of pgAdmin in Kubernetes production environments is beyond the
    scope of this document and, more broadly, of the CloudNativePG project.

However, **for the purposes of demonstration and evaluation**, CloudNativePG
offers a suitable solution. The `cnpg` plugin implements the `pgadmin4`
command, providing a straightforward method to connect to a given database
`Cluster` and navigate its content in a local environment such as `kind`.

For example, you can install a demo deployment of pgAdmin4 for the
`cluster-example` cluster as follows:

```sh
kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 cluster-example
```

This command will produce:

```output
ConfigMap/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created
Deployment/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created
Service/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created
Secret/cluster-example-pgadmin4 created

[...]
```

After deploying pgAdmin, forward the port using kubectl and connect
through your browser by following the on-screen instructions.

![Screenshot of desktop installation of pgAdmin](images/pgadmin4.png)

As usual, you can use the `--dry-run` option to generate the YAML file:

```sh
kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --dry-run cluster-example
```

pgAdmin4 can be installed in either desktop or server mode, with the default
being server.

In `server` mode, authentication is required using a randomly generated password,
and users must manually specify the database to connect to.

On the other hand, `desktop` mode initiates a pgAdmin web interface without
requiring authentication. It automatically connects to the `app` database as the
`app` user, making it ideal for quick demos, such as on a local deployment using
`kind`:

```sh
kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --mode desktop cluster-example
```

After concluding your demo, ensure the termination of the pgAdmin deployment by
executing:

```sh
kubectl cnpg pgadmin4 --dry-run cluster-example | kubectl delete -f -
```

!!! Warning
    Never deploy pgAdmin in production using the plugin.

### Logical Replication Publications

The `cnpg publication` command group is designed to streamline the creation and
removal of [PostgreSQL logical replication publications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html).
Be aware that these commands are primarily intended for assisting in the
creation of logical replication publications, particularly on remote PostgreSQL
databases.

!!! Warning
    It is crucial to have a solid understanding of both the capabilities and
    limitations of PostgreSQL's native logical replication system before using
    these commands.
    In particular, be mindful of the [logical replication restrictions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html).

#### Creating a new publication

To create a logical replication publication, use the `cnpg publication create`
command. The basic structure of this command is as follows:

```sh
kubectl cnpg publication create \
  --publication <PUBLICATION_NAME> \
  [--external-cluster <EXTERNAL_CLUSTER>]
  <LOCAL_CLUSTER> [options]
```

There are two primary use cases:

- With `--external-cluster`: Use this option to create a publication on an
  external cluster (i.e. defined in the `externalClusters` stanza). The commands
  will be issued from the `<LOCAL_CLUSTER>`, but the publication will be for the
  data in `<EXTERNAL_CLUSTER>`.

- Without `--external-cluster`: Use this option to create a publication in the
  `<LOCAL_CLUSTER>` PostgreSQL `Cluster` (by default, the `app` database).

!!! Warning
    When connecting to an external cluster, ensure that the specified user has
    sufficient permissions to execute the `CREATE PUBLICATION` command.

You have several options, similar to the [`CREATE PUBLICATION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html)
command, to define the group of tables to replicate. Notable options include:

- If you specify the `--all-tables` option, you create a publication `FOR ALL TABLES`.
- Alternatively, you can specify multiple occurrences of:
  - `--table`: Add a specific table (with an expression) to the publication.
  - `--schema`: Include all tables in the specified database schema (available
    from PostgreSQL 15).

The `--dry-run` option enables you to preview the SQL commands that the plugin
will execute.

For additional information and detailed instructions, type the following
command:

```sh
kubectl cnpg publication create --help
```

##### Example

Given a `source-cluster` and a `destination-cluster`, we would like to create a
publication for the data on `source-cluster`.
The `destination-cluster` has an entry in the `externalClusters` stanza pointing
to `source-cluster`.

We can run:

``` sh
kubectl cnpg publication create destination-cluster  \
  --external-cluster=source-cluster --all-tables
```

which will create a publication for all tables on `source-cluster`, running
the SQL commands on the `destination-cluster`.

Or instead, we can run:

``` sh
kubectl cnpg publication create source-cluster \
  --publication=app --all-tables
```

which will create a publication named `app` for all the tables in the
`source-cluster`, running the SQL commands on the source cluster.

!!! Info
    There are two sample files that have been provided for illustration and inspiration:
    [logical-source](samples/cluster-example-logical-source.yaml) and
    [logical-destination](samples/cluster-example-logical-destination.yaml).

#### Dropping a publication

The `cnpg publication drop` command seamlessly complements the `create` command
by offering similar key options, including the publication name, cluster name,
and an optional external cluster. You can drop a `PUBLICATION` with the
following command structure:

```sh
kubectl cnpg publication drop \
  --publication <PUBLICATION_NAME> \
  [--external-cluster <EXTERNAL_CLUSTER>]
  <LOCAL_CLUSTER> [options]
```

To access further details and precise instructions, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl cnpg publication drop --help
```

### Logical Replication Subscriptions

The `cnpg subscription` command group is a dedicated set of commands designed
to simplify the creation and removal of
[PostgreSQL logical replication subscriptions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-subscription.html).
These commands are specifically crafted to aid in the establishment of logical
replication subscriptions, especially when dealing with remote PostgreSQL
databases.

!!! Warning
    Before using these commands, it is essential to have a comprehensive
    understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of PostgreSQL's
    native logical replication system.
    In particular, be mindful of the [logical replication restrictions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html).

In addition to subscription management, we provide a helpful command for
synchronizing all sequences from the source cluster. While its applicability
may vary, this command can be particularly useful in scenarios involving major
upgrades or data import from remote servers.

#### Creating a new subscription

To create a logical replication subscription, use the `cnpg subscription create`
command. The basic structure of this command is as follows:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subscription create \
  --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_NAME> \
  --publication <PUBLICATION_NAME> \
  --external-cluster <EXTERNAL_CLUSTER> \
  <LOCAL_CLUSTER> [options]
```

This command configures a subscription directed towards the specified
publication in the designated external cluster, as defined in the
`externalClusters` stanza of the `<LOCAL_CLUSTER>`.

For additional information and detailed instructions, type the following
command:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subscription create --help
```

##### Example

As in the section on publications, we have a `source-cluster` and a
`destination-cluster`, and we have already created a publication called
`app`.

The following command:

``` sh
kubectl cnpg subscription create destination-cluster \
  --external-cluster=source-cluster \
  --publication=app --subscription=app
```

will create a subscription for `app` on the destination cluster.

!!! Warning
    Prioritize testing subscriptions in a non-production environment to ensure
    their effectiveness and identify any potential issues before implementing them
    in a production setting.

!!! Info
    There are two sample files that have been provided for illustration and inspiration:
    [logical-source](samples/cluster-example-logical-source.yaml) and
    [logical-destination](samples/cluster-example-logical-destination.yaml).

#### Dropping a subscription

The `cnpg subscription drop` command seamlessly complements the `create` command.
You can drop a `SUBSCRIPTION` with the following command structure:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subcription drop \
  --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_NAME> \
  <LOCAL_CLUSTER> [options]
```

To access further details and precise instructions, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subscription drop --help
```

#### Synchronizing sequences

One notable constraint of PostgreSQL logical replication, implemented through
publications and subscriptions, is the lack of sequence synchronization. This
becomes particularly relevant when utilizing logical replication for live
database migration, especially to a higher version of PostgreSQL. A crucial
step in this process involves updating sequences before transitioning
applications to the new database (*cutover*).

To address this limitation, the `cnpg subscription sync-sequences` command
offers a solution. This command establishes a connection with the source
database, retrieves all relevant sequences, and subsequently updates local
sequences with matching identities (based on database schema and sequence
name).

You can use the command as shown below:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences \
  --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_NAME> \
  <LOCAL_CLUSTER>
```

For comprehensive details and specific instructions, utilize the following
command:

```sh
kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences --help
```

##### Example

As in the previous sections for publication and subscription, we have
a `source-cluster` and a `destination-cluster`. The publication and the
subscription, both called `app`, are already present.

The following command will synchronize the sequences involved in the
`app` subscription, from the source cluster into the destination cluster.

``` sh
kubectl cnpg subscription sync-sequences destination-cluster \
  --subscription=app
```

!!! Warning
    Prioritize testing subscriptions in a non-production environment to
    guarantee their effectiveness and detect any potential issues before deploying
    them in a production setting.

## Integration with K9s

The `cnpg` plugin can be easily integrated in [K9s](https://k9scli.io/), a
popular terminal-based UI to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

See [`k9s/plugins.yml`](samples/k9s/plugins.yml) for details.
