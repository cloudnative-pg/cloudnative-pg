# Replica clusters

A replica cluster is an independent CloudNativePG `Cluster` resource that has
the main characteristic to be in replica from another Postgres instance,
ideally also managed by CloudNativePG. Normally, a replica cluster is in another
Kubernetes cluster in another region. Replica clusters can be cascading too,
and they can solely rely on object stores for replication of the data from
the source, as described further down.

The diagram below - taken from the ["Architecture"
section](architecture.md#multi-cluster-deployments) containing more
information about this capability - shows just an example of architecture
that you can implement with replica clusters.

## Basic concepts

CloudNativePG relies on the foundations of the PostgreSQL replication
framework even when a PostgreSQL cluster is created from an existing one (source)
and kept synchronized through the
[replica cluster](architecture.md#multi-cluster-deployments) feature. The source
can be a primary cluster or another replica cluster (cascading replica cluster).

The available options in terms of replication, both at bootstrap and continuous
recovery level, are:

- use streaming replication between the replica cluster and the source
  (this will certainly require some administrative and security related
  work to be done to make sure that the network connection between the
  two clusters are correctly setup)
- use a Barman Cloud object store for recovery of the base backups and
  the WAL files that are regularly shipped from the source to the object
  store and pulled by `barman-cloud-wal-restore` in the replica cluster
- any of the two

All you have to do is actually define an external cluster.
Please refer to the ["Bootstrap" section](bootstrap.md#bootstrap-from-another-cluster)
for information on how to clone a PostgreSQL server using either
`pg_basebackup` (streaming) or `recovery` (object store).

If the external cluster contains a `barmanObjectStore` section:

- you'll be able to bootstrap the replica cluster from an object store
  using the `recovery` section
- CloudNativePG will automatically set the `restore_command`
  in the designated primary instance

If the external cluster contains a `connectionParameters` section:

- you'll be able to bootstrap the replica cluster via streaming replication
  using the `pg_basebackup` section
- CloudNativePG will automatically set the `primary_conninfo`
  option in the designated primary instance, so that a WAL receiver
  process is started to connect to the source cluster and receive data

The created replica cluster can perform backups in a reserved object store from
the designated primary, enabling symmetric architectures in a distributed
fashion.

You have full flexibility and freedom to decide your favorite
distributed architecture for a PostgreSQL database by choosing:

- a private cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different data
  centers
- a public cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different
  regions
- a mix of the previous two (hybrid)
- a public cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different
  regions and on different Cloud Service Providers

## Setting up a replica cluster

To set up a replica cluster from a source cluster, we need to create a cluster YAML
file and define the following parts accordingly:

- define the `externalClusters` section in the replica cluster
- define the bootstrap part for the replica cluster. We can either bootstrap via
  streaming using the `pg_basebackup` section, or bootstrap from an object store
  using the `recovery` section
- define the continuous recovery part (`spec.replica`) in the replica cluster. All
  we need to do is to enable the replica mode through option `spec.replica.enabled`
  and set the `externalClusters` name in option `spec.replica.source`

This **first example** defines a replica cluster using streaming replication in
both bootstrap and continuous recovery. The replica cluster connects to the
source cluster using TLS authentication.

You can check the [sample YAML](samples/cluster-example-replica-streaming.yaml)
in the `samples/` subdirectory.

Note the `bootstrap` and `replica` sections pointing to the source cluster.

```yaml
  bootstrap:
    pg_basebackup:
      source: cluster-example

  replica:
    enabled: true
    source: cluster-example
```

In the `externalClusters` section, remember to use the right namespace for the
host in the `connectionParameters` sub-section.
The `-replication` and `-ca` secrets should have been copied over if necessary,
in case the replica cluster is in a separate namespace.

```yaml
  externalClusters:
  - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>
    connectionParameters:
      host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.<NAMESPACE>.svc
      user: streaming_replica
      sslmode: verify-full
      dbname: postgres
    sslKey:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication
      key: tls.key
    sslCert:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication
      key: tls.crt
    sslRootCert:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-ca
      key: ca.crt
```

The **second example** defines a replica cluster that bootstraps from an object
store using the `recovery` section and continuous recovery using both streaming
replication and the given object store. For streaming replication, the replica
cluster connects to the source cluster using basic authentication.

You can check the [sample YAML](samples/cluster-example-replica-from-backup-simple.yaml)
for it in the `samples/` subdirectory.

Note the `bootstrap` and `replica` sections pointing to the source cluster.

```yaml
  bootstrap:
    recovery:
      source: cluster-example

  replica:
    enabled: true
    source: cluster-example
```

In the `externalClusters` section, take care to use the right namespace in the
`endpointURL` and the `connectionParameters.host`.
And do ensure that the necessary secrets have been copied if necessary, and that
a backup of the source cluster has been created already.

```yaml
  externalClusters:
  - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>
    barmanObjectStore:
      destinationPath: s3://backups/
      endpointURL: http://minio:9000
      s3Credentials:
        â€¦
    connectionParameters:
      host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.default.svc
      user: postgres
      dbname: postgres
    password:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-superuser
      key: password
```

!!! Note
    To use streaming replication between the source cluster and the replica
    cluster, we need to make sure there is network connectivity between the two
    clusters, and that all the necessary secrets which hold passwords or
    certificates are properly created in advance.

## Promoting the designated primary in the replica cluster

To promote the **designated primary** to **primary**, all we need to do is to
disable the replica mode in the replica cluster through the option
`spec.replica.enabled`

```yaml
 replica:
   enabled: false
   source: cluster-example
```

Once the replica mode is disabled, the replica cluster and the source cluster
will become two separate clusters, and the **designated primary** in the replica
cluster will be promoted to be that cluster's **primary**. We can verify the role
change using the cnpg plugin, checking the status of the cluster which was
previously the replica:

```shell
kubectl cnpg -n <cluster-name-space> status cluster-replica-example
```

!!! Note
    Disabling replication is an **irreversible** operation: once replication is
    disabled and the **designated primary** is promoted to **primary**, the
    replica cluster and the source cluster will become two independent clusters
    definitively.
