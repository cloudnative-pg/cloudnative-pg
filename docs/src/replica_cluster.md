# Replica clusters

A replica cluster is an independent CloudNativePG `Cluster` resource that has
the main characteristic to be in replica from another Postgres instance,
ideally also managed by CloudNativePG. Normally, a replica cluster is in another
Kubernetes cluster in another region. Replica clusters can be cascading too,
and they can solely rely on object stores for replication of the data from
the source, as described further down.

The diagram below - taken from the ["Architecture"
section](architecture.md#deployments-across-kubernetes-clusters) containing more
information about this capability - shows just an example of architecture
that you can implement with replica clusters.

## Basic concepts

CloudNativePG relies on the foundations of the PostgreSQL replication
framework even when a PostgreSQL cluster is created from an existing one (source)
and kept synchronized through the
[replica cluster](architecture.md#deployments-across-kubernetes-clusters) feature. The source
can be a primary cluster or another replica cluster (cascading replica cluster).

The first step is to bootstrap the replica cluster, choosing among one of the
available methods:

- streaming replication, via `pg_basebackup`
- recovery from a volume snapshot
- recovery from a Barman Cloud backup in an object store

Please refer to the ["Bootstrap" section](bootstrap.md#bootstrap-from-another-cluster)
for information on how to clone a PostgreSQL server using either
`pg_basebackup` (streaming) or `recovery` (volume snapshot or object store).

Once the replica cluster's base backup is available, you need to define how
changes are replicated from the origin, through PostgreSQL continuous recovery.
There are two options:

- use streaming replication between the replica cluster and the source
  (this will certainly require some administrative and security related
  work to be done to make sure that the network connection between the
  two clusters are correctly setup)
- use the WAL archive (on an object store) to fetch the WAL files that are
  regularly shipped from the source to the object store and pulled by
  `barman-cloud-wal-restore` in the replica cluster
- any of the two

All you have to do is actually define an external cluster.

If the external cluster contains a `barmanObjectStore` section:

- you'll be able to use the WAL archive, and CloudNativePG will automatically
  set the `restore_command` in the designated primary instance
- you'll be able to bootstrap the replica cluster from an object store
  using the `recovery` section, in case you cannot take advantage of
  volume snapshots

If the external cluster contains a `connectionParameters` section:

- you'll be able to bootstrap the replica cluster via streaming replication
  using the `pg_basebackup` section
- CloudNativePG will automatically set the `primary_conninfo`
  option in the designated primary instance, so that a WAL receiver
  process is started to connect to the source cluster and receive data

The created replica cluster can perform backups in a reserved object store from
the designated primary, enabling symmetric architectures in a distributed
fashion.

You have full flexibility and freedom to decide your favorite
distributed architecture for a PostgreSQL database by choosing:

- a private cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different data
  centers
- a public cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different
  regions
- a mix of the previous two (hybrid)
- a public cloud spanning over multiple Kubernetes clusters in different
  regions and on different Cloud Service Providers

## Setting up a replica cluster

To set up a replica cluster from a source cluster, we need to create a cluster YAML
file and define the following parts accordingly:

- define the `externalClusters` section in the replica cluster
- define the bootstrap part for the replica cluster. We can either bootstrap via
  streaming using the `pg_basebackup` section, or bootstrap from a volume snapshot
  or an object store using the `recovery` section
- define the continuous recovery part (`.spec.replica`) in the replica cluster. All
  we need to do is to enable the replica mode through option `.spec.replica.enabled`
  and set the `externalClusters` name in option `.spec.replica.source`

#### Example using pg_basebackup

This **first example** defines a replica cluster using streaming replication in
both bootstrap and continuous recovery. The replica cluster connects to the
source cluster using TLS authentication.

You can check the [sample YAML](samples/cluster-example-replica-streaming.yaml)
in the `samples/` subdirectory.

Note the `bootstrap` and `replica` sections pointing to the source cluster.

```yaml
  bootstrap:
    pg_basebackup:
      source: cluster-example

  replica:
    enabled: true
    source: cluster-example
```

In the `externalClusters` section, remember to use the right namespace for the
host in the `connectionParameters` sub-section.
The `-replication` and `-ca` secrets should have been copied over if necessary,
in case the replica cluster is in a separate namespace.

```yaml
  externalClusters:
  - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>
    connectionParameters:
      host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.<NAMESPACE>.svc
      user: streaming_replica
      sslmode: verify-full
      dbname: postgres
    sslKey:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication
      key: tls.key
    sslCert:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-replication
      key: tls.crt
    sslRootCert:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-ca
      key: ca.crt
```

#### Example using a Backup from an object store

The **second example** defines a replica cluster that bootstraps from an object
store using the `recovery` section and continuous recovery using both streaming
replication and the given object store. For streaming replication, the replica
cluster connects to the source cluster using basic authentication.

You can check the [sample YAML](samples/cluster-example-replica-from-backup-simple.yaml)
for it in the `samples/` subdirectory.

Note the `bootstrap` and `replica` sections pointing to the source cluster.

```yaml
  bootstrap:
    recovery:
      source: cluster-example

  replica:
    enabled: true
    source: cluster-example
```

In the `externalClusters` section, take care to use the right namespace in the
`endpointURL` and the `connectionParameters.host`.
And do ensure that the necessary secrets have been copied if necessary, and that
a backup of the source cluster has been created already.

```yaml
  externalClusters:
  - name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>
    barmanObjectStore:
      destinationPath: s3://backups/
      endpointURL: http://minio:9000
      s3Credentials:
        â€¦
    connectionParameters:
      host: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-rw.default.svc
      user: postgres
      dbname: postgres
    password:
      name: <MAIN-CLUSTER>-superuser
      key: password
```

!!! Note
    To use streaming replication between the source cluster and the replica
    cluster, we need to make sure there is network connectivity between the two
    clusters, and that all the necessary secrets which hold passwords or
    certificates are properly created in advance.

#### Example using a Volume Snapshot

If you use volume snapshots and your storage class provides
snapshots cross-cluster availability, you can leverage that to
bootstrap a replica cluster through a volume snapshot of the
source cluster.

The **third example** defines a replica cluster that bootstraps
from a volume snapshot using the `recovery` section. It uses
streaming replication (via basic authentication) and the object
store to fetch the WAL files.

You can check the [sample YAML](samples/cluster-example-replica-from-volume-snapshot.yaml)
for it in the `samples/` subdirectory.

## Demoting a Primary to a Replica Cluster

CloudNativePG provides the functionality to demote a primary cluster to a
replica cluster. This action is typically planned when transitioning the
primary role from one data center to another. The process involves demoting the
current primary cluster (e.g., cluster-eu-south) to a replica cluster and
subsequently promoting the designated replica cluster (e.g.,
`cluster-eu-central`) to primary when fully synchronized.
Provided you have defined an external cluster in the current primary `Cluster`
resource that points to the replica cluster that's been selected to become the
new primary, all you need to do is to enable replica mode and define the source
as follows:

```yaml
 replica:
   enabled: true
   source: cluster-eu-central
```

## Promoting the designated primary in the replica cluster

To promote a replica cluster (e.g. `cluster-eu-central`) to a primary cluster
and make the designated primary a real primary, all you need to do is to
disable the replica mode in the replica cluster through the option
`.spec.replica.enabled`:

```yaml
 replica:
   enabled: false
   source: cluster-eu-south
```

If you have first demoted the `cluster-eu-south` and waited for
`cluster-eu-central` to be in sync, once `cluster-eu-central` starts as
primary, the `cluster-eu-south` cluster will seamlessly start as a replica
cluster, without the need of re-cloning.

If you disable replica mode without prior demotion, the replica cluster and the
source cluster will become two separate clusters.

When replica mode is disabled, the **designated primary** in the replica
cluster will be promoted to be that cluster's **primary**.

You can verify the role change using the `cnpg` plugin, checking the status of
the cluster which was previously the replica:

```shell
kubectl cnpg -n <cluster-name-space> status cluster-eu-central
```

!!! Note
    Disabling replication is an **irreversible** operation. Once replication is
    disabled and the designated primary is promoted to primary, the replica cluster
    and the source cluster become two independent clusters definitively. Ensure to
    follow the demotion procedure correctly to avoid unintended consequences.

## Delayed replicas

In addition to standard replica clusters, our system supports the creation of
**delayed replicas** through the utilization of PostgreSQL's
[`recovery_min_apply_delay`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-RECOVERY-MIN-APPLY-DELAY)
option.

Delayed replicas intentionally lag behind the primary database by a specified
amount of time. This delay is configurable using the `recovery_min_apply_delay`
option in PostgreSQL. The primary objective of introducing delayed replicas is
to mitigate the impact of unintentional executions of SQL statements on the
primary database. This is particularly useful in scenarios where an incorrect
or missing `WHERE` clause is used in operations such as `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

To introduce a delay in a replica cluster, adjust the
`recovery_min_apply_delay` option. This parameter determines the time by which
replicas lag behind the primary. For example:

```yaml
  # ...
  postgresql:
    parameters:
      # Enforce a delay of 8 hours
      recovery_min_apply_delay = '8h'
  # ...
```

Monitor and adjust the delay as needed based on your recovery time objectives
and the potential impact of unintended primary database operations.

The main use cases of delayed replicas can be summarized into:

1. mitigating human errors: reduce the risk of data corruption or loss
   resulting from unintentional SQL operations on the primary database

2. recovery time optimization: facilitate quicker recovery from unintended
   changes by having a delayed replica that allows you to identify and rectify
   issues before changes are applied to other replicas.

3. enhanced data protection: safeguard critical data by introducing a time
   buffer that provides an opportunity to intervene and prevent the propagation of
   undesirable changes.

By integrating delayed replicas into your replication strategy, you can enhance
the resilience and data protection capabilities of your PostgreSQL environment.
Adjust the delay duration based on your specific needs and the criticality of
your data.

!!! Important
    Always measure your goals. Depending on your environment, it might be more
    efficient to rely on volume snapshot-based recovery for faster outcomes.
    Evaluate and choose the approach that best aligns with your unique requirements
    and infrastructure.
