# ImageVolume Extensions
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0 -->

CloudNativePG supports dynamic loading of PostgreSQL extensions into a
running `Cluster`, leveraging the ImageVolume feature of Kubernetes.

This feature allows mounting a PostgreSQL extension, packaged as an
OCI-compliant container image, as a read-only and immutable volume
directly inside a running pod's filesystem at a known path.

## Requirements:
* PostgreSQL 18+
* Kubernetes 1.31+ with the ImageVolume feature gate enabled.

## Key Concepts

Each image volume will be mounted at `/extensions/<EXTENSION_NAME>`.
The operator takes care of automatically managing both
`extension_control_path` and `dynamic_library_path` GUCs, pointing
them by default to:
- `/extension/<EXTENSION_NAME>/share` for `extension_control_path`
- `/extension/<EXTENSION_NAME>/lib` for `dynamic_library_path`

!!! Important
    The extension container image must be compatible with the PostgreSQL image
    deployed, meaning that it should have coherent PostgreSQL major version,
    OS distribution and CPU architecture.

## Adding a new extension

Via the `.spec.postgresql.extensions` stanza, you can define a list of
imageVolume extensions that should be mounted inside a Cluster. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    extensions:
      - name: pgvector
        image:
          reference: pgvector:0.8
          pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

The `name` field is a mandatory unique name that will be used to mount the
imageVolume, which in this case will result to `/extensions/pgvector`.
It must consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start/end
with an alphanumeric character.

!!! Info
    When a new extension is applied on a running Cluster, CloudNativePG will
    perform a [Rolling Update](rolling_update.md) to add the newly requested
    image volume to each pod.

Then, the operator will automatically configure the required GUCs to allow
PostgreSQL to load extensions from the `pgvector` volume, by appending:
- `/extension/pgvector/share` to `extension_control_path`
- `/extension/pgvector/lib` to `dynamic_library_path`

## Manage extensions via configuration

You can take advantage of Declarative Databases to [manage the lifecycle of
your extensions](declarative_database_management.md#managing-extensions-in-a-database)
in a target database.

### Setting custom paths

If your extension container image doesn't adhere to the default `lib` and `share`
directories to host the extension's libraries and control files, you can override the
default behavior and set your own custom paths via the `extension_control_path` and
`dynamic_library_path` fields. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    extensions:
      - name: my-extension
        extension_control_path:
          - my/share/path
        dynamic_library_path:
          - my/lib/path
        image:
          # ...
```

This way, the following paths will be configured in PostgreSQL:
- `/extensions/my-extension/my/share/path` for `extension_control_path`
- `/extension/my-extension/my/lib/path` for `dynamic_library_path`

### Multi-extension image

You may have the necessity to include multiple extensions inside the same container image,
for example by adopting a structure where the files of each extension reside in its subdirectory.
The following example demonstrates how to add a GeoSpatial container image that contains both
PostGIS and pgRouting:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    extensions:
      - name: geospatial
        extension_control_path:
          - postgis/share
          - pgrouting/share
        dynamic_library_path:
          - postgis/lib
          - pgrouting/lib
        image:
          # ...
```

### System Libraries

Some extensions, like PostGIS, require system libraries that may not be included in the default PostgreSQL image.
To support this, these libraries can be packaged within the extensionâ€™s container image and made available to
PostgreSQL via the `ld_library_path` field.

In the example below, the `system` directory contains all necessary system libraries for running PostGIS:

```yaml
spec:
  postgresql:
    extensions:
      - name: postgis
        ld_library_path:
          - system
        image:
          # ...
```

This sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for the PostgreSQL process, which will contain
the path `/extensions/postgis/system`, allowing it to locate and load the required libraries.

!!! Important
    Given that `ld_library_path` needs to be set at the start of the PostgreSQL process,
    changing this value requires a restart of the Cluster for the new value(s) to be picked up.
    Currently, this is not being done automatically and users have to issue a
    `cnpg restart` after changing this value on a running Cluster.
