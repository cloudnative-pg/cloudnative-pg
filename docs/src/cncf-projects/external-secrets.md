# External Secrets

[External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) is a CNCF Sandbox
project, accepted in 2022 under the sponsorship of TAG Security.

## About

The **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** is a Kubernetes operator that enhances
secret management by decoupling the storage of secrets from Kubernetes itself.
It enables seamless synchronization between external secret management systems
and native Kubernetes `Secret` resources.

ESO supports a wide range of backends, including:

- [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
- [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/)
- [IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/secrets-manager)

…and many more. For a full and up-to-date list of supported providers, refer to
the [official External Secrets documentation](https://external-secrets.io/latest/).

## Integration with PostgreSQL and CloudNativePG

When it comes to PostgreSQL databases, External Secrets integrates seamlessly
with [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) in two major use cases:

- **Automated password management:** ESO can handle the automatic generation
  and rotation of database user passwords stored in Kubernetes `Secret`
  resources, ensuring that applications running inside the cluster always have
  access to up-to-date credentials.

- **Cross-platform secret access:** It enables transparent synchronization of
  those passwords with an external Key Management Service (KMS) via a
  `SecretStore` resources. This allows applications and developers outside the
  Kubernetes cluster—who may not have access to Kubernetes secrets—to retrieve
  the database credentials directly from the external KMS.

## Example: Automated Password Management with External Secrets

Let’s walk through how to automatically rotate the password of the `app` user
every 24 hours in the `cluster-example` Postgres cluster from the
[quickstart guide](../quickstart.md#part-3-deploy-a-postgresql-cluster).

!!! Important
    Before proceeding, ensure that the `cluster-example` Postgres cluster is up
    and running in your environment.

By default, CloudNativePG generates and manages a Kubernetes `Secret` named
`cluster-example-app`, which contains the credentials for the `app` user in the
`cluster-example` cluster. You can read more about this in the
[“Connecting from an application” section](../applications.md#secrets).

With External Secrets, the goal is to:

1. Define a `Password` generator that specifies how to generate the password.
2. Create an `ExternalSecret` resource that keeps the `cluster-example-app`
   secret in sync by updating only the `password` and `pgpass` fields.

### Creating the Password Generator

The following example creates a
[`Password` generator](https://external-secrets.io/main/api/generator/password/)
resource named `pg-password-generator` in the `default` namespace. You can
customize the name and properties to suit your needs:

```yaml
apiVersion: generators.external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: Password
metadata:
  name: pg-password-generator
spec:
  length: 42
  digits: 5
  symbols: 5
  symbolCharacters: "-_$@"
  noUpper: false
  allowRepeat: true
```

This specification defines the characteristics of the generated password,
including its length and the inclusion of digits, symbols, and uppercase
letters.

### Creating the External Secret

The example below creates an `ExternalSecret` resource named
`cluster-example-app-secret`, which refreshes the password every 24 hours. It
uses a `Merge` policy to update only the specified fields (`password`, `pgpass`,
`jdbc-uri` and `uri`) in the `cluster-example-app` secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: cluster-example-app-secret
spec:
  refreshInterval: "24h"
  target:
    name: cluster-example-app
    creationPolicy: Merge
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          cnpg.io/reload: "true"
      data:
        password: "{{ .password }}"
        pgpass: "cluster-example-rw:5432:app:app:{{ .password }}"
        jdbc-uri: "jdbc:postgresql://cluster-example-rw.default:5432/app?password={{ .password }}&user=app"
        uri: "postgresql://app:{{ .password }}@cluster-example-rw.default:5432/app"
  dataFrom:
    - sourceRef:
        generatorRef:
          apiVersion: generators.external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
          kind: Password
          name: pg-password-generator
```

The label `cnpg.io/reload: "true"` ensures that CloudNativePG triggers a reload
of the user password in the database when the secret changes.

### Verifying the Configuration

To check that the `ExternalSecret` is correctly synchronizing:

```sh
kubectl get es cluster-example-app-secret
```

To observe the password being refreshed in real time, temporarily reduce the
`refreshInterval` to `30s` and run the following command repeatedly:

```sh
kubectl get secret cluster-example-app \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

You should see the password change every 30 seconds, confirming that the
rotation is working correctly.

### There's More

While the example above focuses on the default `cluster-example-app` secret
created by CloudNativePG, the same approach can be extended to manage any
custom secrets or PostgreSQL users you create to regularly rotate their
password.


## Example: Integration with an External KMS

One of the most widely used Key Management Service (KMS) providers in the CNCF
ecosystem is [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/). Although Vault is
licensed under the Business Source License (BUSL), a fully compatible and
actively maintained open source alternative is available: [OpenBao](https://openbao.org/).
OpenBao supports all the same interfaces as HashiCorp Vault, making it a true
drop-in replacement.

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to integrate CloudNativePG,
External Secrets Operator, and HashiCorp Vault to automatically rotate
a PostgreSQL password and securely store it in Vault.

!!! Important
    This example assumes that HashiCorp Vault is already installed and properly
    configured in your environment, and that your team has the necessary expertise
    to operate it. There are various ways to deploy Vault, and detailing them is
    outside the scope of CloudNativePG. While it's possible to run Vault inside
    Kubernetes, it is more commonly deployed externally. For detailed instructions,
    consult the [HashiCorp Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs).

Continuing from the previous example, we will now create the necessary
`SecretStore` and `PushSecret` resources to complete the integration with
Vault.

### Creating the `SecretStore`

In this example, we assume that HashiCorp Vault is accessible from within the
namespace at `http://vault.vault.svc:8200`, and that a Kubernetes `Secret`
named `vault-token` exists in the same namespace, containing the token used to
authenticate with Vault.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      server: "http://vault.vault.svc:8200"
      path: "secrets"
      # Specifies the Vault KV secret engine version ("v1" or "v2").
      # Defaults to "v2" if not set.
      version: "v2"
      auth:
        # References a Kubernetes Secret that contains the Vault token.
        # See: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token
        tokenSecretRef:
          name: "vault-token"
          key: "token"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vault-token
data:
  token: aHZzLioqKioqKio= # hvs.*******
```

This configuration creates a `SecretStore` resource named `vault-backend`.

!!! Important
    This example uses basic token-based authentication, which is suitable for
    testing API, and CLI use cases. While it is the default method enabled in
    Vault, it is not recommended for production environments. For production,
    consider using more secure authentication methods.
    Refer to the [External Secrets Operator documentation](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/hashicorp-vault/)
    for a full list of supported authentication mechanisms.

!!! Info
    HashiCorp Vault must have a KV secrets engine enabled at the `secrets` path
    with version `v2`. If your Vault instance uses a different path or
    version, be sure to update the `path` and `version` fields accordingly.

### Creating the `PushSecret`

The `PushSecret` resource is used to push a Kubernetes `Secret` to HashiCorp
Vault. In this simplified example, we'll push the credentials for the `app`
user of the sample cluster `cluster-example`.

For more details on configuring `PushSecret`, refer to the
[External Secrets Operator documentation](https://external-secrets.io/latest/api/pushsecret/).

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1alpha1
kind: PushSecret
metadata:
  name: pushsecret-example
spec:
  deletionPolicy: Delete
  refreshInterval: 24h
  secretStoreRefs:
    - name: vault-backend
      kind: SecretStore
  selector:
    secret:
      name: cluster-example-app
  data:
    - match:
        remoteRef:
          remoteKey: cluster-example-app
```

In this example, the `PushSecret` resource instructs the External Secrets
Operator to push the Kubernetes `Secret` named `cluster-example-app` to
HashiCorp Vault (from the previous example). The `remoteKey` defines the name
under which the secret will be stored in Vault, using the `SecretStore` named
`vault-backend`.

### Verifying the Configuration

To verify that the `PushSecret` is functioning correctly, navigate to the
HashiCorp Vault UI. In the `kv` secrets engine at the path `secrets`, you
should find a secret named `cluster-example-app`, corresponding to the
`remoteKey` defined above.
