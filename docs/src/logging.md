# Logging

The operator is designed to log in JSON format directly to standard output,
including PostgreSQL logs.

Each log entry has the following fields:

- `level` – Log level (`info`, `notice`, ...).
- `ts` – The timestamp (epoch with microseconds).
- `logger` – The type of the record (for example, `postgres` or `pg_controldata`).
- `msg` – The actual message or the keyword `record` in case the message is parsed in JSON format.
- `record` – The actual record with structure that varies depending on the
  `logger` type.
- `logging_podName` – The pod where the log was created.

!!! Warning
    Long-term storage and management of logs is outside the operator's purview,
    and needs to be provided at the level of the Kubernetes installation.
    See the
    [Kubernetes Logging Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/)
    documentation.

!!! Info
    If your log ingestion system requires it, you can rename the `level` and `ts` field names using the `log-field-level` and
    `log-field-timestamp` flags of the operator controller. Edit the `Deployment` definition of the
    `cloudnative-pg` operator.

## Operator log

You can specify a log level in the cluster spec with the option `logLevel`.
You can set it to `error`, `warning`, `info`(default), `debug`, or `trace`.

Currently, you can set the log level only when an instance starts. You can't
change it at runtime. If you change the value in the cluster spec after the cluster
was started, it takes effect only in the new pods and not the old ones.

## PostgreSQL log

Each entry in the PostgreSQL log is a JSON object having the `logger` key set
to `postgres` and the structure described in the following example:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": 1619781249.7188137,
  "logger": "postgres",
  "msg": "record",
  "record": {
    "log_time": "2021-04-30 11:14:09.718 UTC",
    "user_name": "",
    "database_name": "",
    "process_id": "25",
    "connection_from": "",
    "session_id": "608be681.19",
    "session_line_num": "1",
    "command_tag": "",
    "session_start_time": "2021-04-30 11:14:09 UTC",
    "virtual_transaction_id": "",
    "transaction_id": "0",
    "error_severity": "LOG",
    "sql_state_code": "00000",
    "message": "database system was interrupted; last known up at 2021-04-30 11:14:07 UTC",
    "detail": "",
    "hint": "",
    "internal_query": "",
    "internal_query_pos": "",
    "context": "",
    "query": "",
    "query_pos": "",
    "location": "",
    "application_name": "",
    "backend_type": "startup"
  },
  "logging_pod": "cluster-example-1",
}
```

Internally, the operator relies on the PostgreSQL CSV log format. See
the PostgreSQL documentation for more information about the [CSV log
format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html).

## PGAudit logs

CloudNativePG has transparent and native support for
[PGAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) on PostgreSQL clusters.

To enable this support, add the required `pgaudit` parameters to the `postgresql`
section in the configuration of the cluster.

!!! Important
    You need to add the PGAudit library to `shared_preload_libraries`.
    CloudNativePG adds the library based on the
    presence of `pgaudit.*` parameters in the postgresql configuration.
    The operator detects and manages the addition and removal of the
    library from `shared_preload_libraries`.

The operator also takes care of creating and removing the extension from all
the available databases in the cluster.

!!! Important
    CloudNativePG runs the `CREATE EXTENSION` and
    `DROP EXTENSION` commands in all databases in the cluster that accept
    connections.

This example shows a PostgreSQL 13 `Cluster` deployment that results in
`pgaudit` being enabled with the requested configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:13

  postgresql:
    parameters:
      "pgaudit.log": "all, -misc"
      "pgaudit.log_catalog": "off"
      "pgaudit.log_parameter": "on"
      "pgaudit.log_relation": "on"

  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

The audit CSV logs entries returned by PGAudit are then parsed and routed to
stdout in JSON format, similarly to all the remaining logs:

- `.logger` is set to `pgaudit`.
- `.msg` is set to `record`.
- `.record` contains the whole parsed record as a JSON object. This is similar to
  `logging_collector` logs, except for `.record.audit`, which contains the
  PGAudit CSV message formatted as a JSON object.

This example shows sample log entries:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": 1627394507.8814096,
  "logger": "pgaudit",
  "msg": "record",
  "record": {
    "log_time": "2021-07-27 14:01:47.881 UTC",
    "user_name": "postgres",
    "database_name": "postgres",
    "process_id": "203",
    "connection_from": "[local]",
    "session_id": "610011cb.cb",
    "session_line_num": "1",
    "command_tag": "SELECT",
    "session_start_time": "2021-07-27 14:01:47 UTC",
    "virtual_transaction_id": "3/336",
    "transaction_id": "0",
    "error_severity": "LOG",
    "sql_state_code": "00000",
    "backend_type": "client backend",
    "audit": {
      "audit_type": "SESSION",
      "statement_id": "1",
      "substatement_id": "1",
      "class": "READ",
      "command": "SELECT FOR KEY SHARE",
      "statement": "SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn()",
      "parameter": "<none>"
    }
  },
  "logging_pod": "cluster-example-1",
}
```

[PGAudit documentation](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/master/README.md#format) <!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
for more details about each field in a record.

## Other logs

All logs that are produced by the operator and its instances are in JSON
format, with `logger` set according to the process that produced them.
Therefore, all the possible `logger` values are the following:

- `barman-cloud-wal-archive`: from `barman-cloud-wal-archive` directly
- `barman-cloud-wal-restore`: from `barman-cloud-wal-restore` directly
- `initdb`: from running `initdb`
- `pg_basebackup`: from running `pg_basebackup`
- `pg_controldata`: from running `pg_controldata`
- `pg_ctl`: from running any `pg_ctl` subcommand
- `pg_rewind`: from running `pg_rewind`
- `pgaudit`: from PGAudit extension
- `postgres`: from the `postgres` instance (having `msg` different than `record`)
- `wal-archive`: from the `wal-archive` subcommand of the instance manager
- `wal-restore`: from the `wal-restore` subcommand of the instance manager
- `instance-manager`: from the [PostgreSQL instance manager](./instance_manager.md)

Except for `postgres`, which has the aforementioned structures,
all other possible values have `msg` set to the escaped message that's
logged.
