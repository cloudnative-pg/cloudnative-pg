# Database Role Management

From its inception, CloudNativePG has managed the creation of specific roles required in PostgreSQL instances:

- The superuser `postgres` and the `streaming_replica` role
- The application user, set as the low-privilege owner of the application database

This process is described in the ["Bootstrap"](bootstrap.md) section.

With the `managed` stanza in the cluster spec, CloudNativePG now provides full lifecycle management for roles specified 
in `.spec.managed.roles`.

This feature enables declarative management of existing roles, as well as the creation of new roles if they are not 
already present in the database. Role creation will occur *after* the database bootstrapping is complete.

An example manifest for a cluster with declarative role management can be found in the file [`cluster-example-with-roles.yaml`](samples/cluster-example-with-roles.yaml).

An excerpt from that file:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
spec:
  managed:
    roles:
    - name: cnpg_admin
      ensure: present
      comment: my database-side comment
      login: true
      superuser: false
```
The role specification in `spec.managed.roles` adheres to the [PostgreSQL structure and naming conventions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).  
A few points are worth noting:

1. The `ensure` attribute is **not** part of PostgreSQL. It enables declarative role management to create and remove roles. 
   The two possible values are `present` (the default) and `absent`.
2. The `inherit` attribute is true by default, following PostgreSQL conventions.
3. The `connectionLimit` attribute defaults to -1, in line with PostgreSQL conventions.

Declarative role management ensures that PostgreSQL instances align with the spec. If a user modifies role attributes 
directly in the database, the CloudNativePG operator will revert those changes during the next reconciliation cycle.

The CRD status includes a section for the managed roles' status, as shown below:

```yaml
  roleStatus:
    not-managed:
    - app
    pending-reconciliation:
    - cnpg_admin
    reserved:
    - postgres
    - streaming_replica
```

This section covers roles reserved for operator use and those that are **not** under declarative management, providing a
comprehensive view of the roles in the database instances.

In terms of backward compatibility, declarative role management is designed to ignore roles that exist in the database 
but are not included in the spec. The lifecycle of these roles will continue to be managed within PostgreSQL, allowing 
CloudNativePG users to adopt this feature at their convenience.
