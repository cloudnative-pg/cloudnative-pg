# Architecture

For High Availability and Scalability goals, the PostgreSQL database management
system provides administrators with built-in **physical replication**
capabilities based on **Write Ahead Log (WAL) shipping**.

PostgreSQL supports both asynchronous and synchronous streaming replication
over the network, as well as asynchronous file-based log shipping (normally
used as a fallback option, for example, to store WAL files in an object store).
Replicas are usually called *standby servers* and can also be used for
read-only workloads, thanks to the *Hot Standby* feature.

Cloud Native PostgreSQL supports clusters based on asynchronous and synchronous
streaming replication to manage multiple hot standby replicas within the same
Kubernetes cluster, with the following specifications:

* One primary, with optional multiple hot standby replicas for High Availability
* Available services for applications:
    * `-rw`: applications connect to the only primary instance of the cluster
    * `-ro`: applications connect to the only hot standby replicas for read-only-workloads
    * `-r`: applications connect to any of the instances for read-only workloads
* Shared-nothing architecture recommended for better resilience of the PostgreSQL cluster:
    * PostgreSQL instances should reside on different Kubernetes worker nodes
      and share only the network
    * PostgreSQL instances can reside in different
      availability zones in the same region
    * All nodes of a PostgreSQL cluster should reside in the same region

    Please refer to the ["Replication" section](replication.md) for more
    information about how Cloud Native PostgreSQL relies on PostgreSQL replication,
    including synchronous settings.

## Read-write workloads

Applications can decide to connect to the PostgreSQL instance elected as
*current primary* by the Kubernetes operator, as depicted in the following
diagram:

![Applications writing to the single primary](./images/architecture-rw.png)

Applications can use the `-rw` suffix service.

In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, Kubernetes
will move the `-rw` service to another instance of the cluster for high availability
purposes.

## Read-only workloads

!!! Important
    Applications must be aware of the limitations that
    [Hot Standby](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html)
    presents and familiar with the way PostgreSQL operates when dealing with
    these workloads.

Applications can access hot standby replicas through the `-ro` service made available
by the operator. This service enables the application to offload read-only queries from the
primary node.

The following diagram shows the architecture:

![Applications reading from hot standby replicas in round robin](./images/architecture-read-only.png)

Applications can also access any PostgreSQL instance through the
`-r` service.

## Application deployments

Applications are supposed to work with the services created by Cloud Native PostgreSQL
in the same Kubernetes cluster:

* `[cluster name]-rw`
* `[cluster name]-ro`
* `[cluster name]-r`

Those services are entirely managed by the Kubernetes cluster and
implement a form of Virtual IP as described in the
["Service" page of the Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies).

!!! Hint
    It is highly recommended using those services in your applications,
    and avoiding connecting directly to a specific PostgreSQL instance, as the latter
    can change during the cluster lifetime.

You can use these services in your applications through:

* DNS resolution
* environment variables

For the credentials to connect to PostgreSQL, you can
use the secrets generated by the operator.

!!! Warning
    The operator will create another service, named `[cluster name]-any`. That
    service is used internally to manage PostgreSQL instance discovery.
    It's not supposed to be used directly by applications.

### DNS resolution

You can use the Kubernetes DNS service to point to a given server.
The Kubernetes DNS service is required by the operator.
You can do that by using the name of the service if the application is
deployed in the same namespace as the PostgreSQL cluster.
In case the PostgreSQL cluster resides in a different namespace, you can use the
full qualifier: `service-name.namespace-name`.

DNS is the preferred and recommended discovery method.

### Environment variables

If you deploy your application in the same namespace that contains the
PostgreSQL cluster, you can also use environment variables to connect to the database.

For example, suppose that your PostgreSQL cluster is called `pg-database`,
you can use the following environment variables in your applications:

* `PG_DATABASE_R_SERVICE_HOST`: the IP address of the service
  pointing to all the PostgreSQL instances for read-only workloads

* `PG_DATABASE_RO_SERVICE_HOST`: the IP address of the
  service pointing to all hot-standby replicas of the cluster

* `PG_DATABASE_RW_SERVICE_HOST`: the IP address of the
  service pointing to the *primary* instance of the cluster

### Secrets

The PostgreSQL operator will generate two `basic-auth` type secrets for every
PostgreSQL cluster it deploys:

* `[cluster name]-superuser`
* `[cluster name]-app`

The secrets contain the username, password, and a working
[`.pgpass file`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html)
respectively for the `postgres` user and the *owner* of the database.

The `-app` credentials are the ones that should be used by applications
connecting to the PostgreSQL cluster.

The `-superuser` ones are supposed to be used only for administrative purposes.

## Multi-cluster deployments

!!! Info
    Cloud Native PostgreSQL supports deploying PostgreSQL across multiple
    Kubernetes clusters through a feature called **Replica Cluster**,
    which is described in this section.

In a distributed PostgreSQL cluster there can only be a single PostgreSQL
instance acting as a primary at all times. This means that applications can
only write inside a single Kubernetes cluster, at any time.

!!! Tip
    If you are interested in a PostgreSQL architecture where all instances accept writes, 
    please take a look at  [BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) by EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest/). 
    For Kubernetes, BDR will have its own Operator, expected late in 2021. 

However, for business continuity objectives it is fundamental to:

- reduce global **recovery point objectives** (RPO) by storing PostgreSQL backup data
  in multiple locations, regions and possibly using different providers
  (**Disaster Recovery**)
- reduce global **recovery time objectives** (RTO) by taking advantage of PostgreSQL
  replication beyond the primary Kubernetes cluster (**High Availability**)

In order to address the above concerns, Cloud Native PostgreSQL introduces the
concept of a *PostgreSQL Replica Cluster*. Replica clusters are the Cloud
Native PostgreSQL way to enable multi-cluster deployments in private, public,
hybrid, and multi-cloud contexts.

A replica cluster is a separate `Cluster` resource:

1. having either `pg_basebackup` or full `recovery` as the `bootstrap`
   option from a defined external source cluster
2. having the `replica.enabled` option set to `true`
3. replicating from a defined external cluster identified by `replica.source`,
   normally located outside the Kubernetes cluster
4. replaying WAL information received from the recovery object store
   (using PostgreSQL's `restore_command` parameter), or via streaming
   replication (using PostgreSQL's `primary_conninfo` parameter), or any of
   the two (in case both the `barmanObjectStore` and `connectionParameters`
   are defined in the external cluster)
5. accepting only read connections, as supported by PostgreSQL's Hot Standby

!!! Seealso
    Please refer to the ["Bootstrap" section](bootstrap.md) for more information
    about cloning a PostgreSQL cluster from another one (defined in the
    `externalClusters` section).

The diagram below depicts a PostgreSQL cluster spanning over two different
Kubernetes clusters, where the primary cluster is in the first Kubernetes
cluster and the replica cluster is in the second. The second Kubernetes cluster
acts as the company's disaster recovery cluster, ready to be activated in case
of disaster and unavailability of the first one.

![An example of multi-cluster deployment with a primary and a replica cluster](./images/multi-cluster.png)

A replica cluster can have the same architecture of the primary cluster. In
place of the primary instance, a replica cluster has a **designated primary**
instance, which is a standby server with an arbitrary number of cascading
standby servers in streaming replication (symmetric architecture).

The designated primary can be promoted at any time, making the replica cluster
a primary cluster capable of accepting write connections.

!!! Warning
    Cloud Native PostgreSQL does not perform any cross-cluster switchover
    or failover at the moment. Such operation must be performed manually
    or delegated to a multi-cluster/federated cluster aware authority.
    Each PostgreSQL cluster is independent from any other.

The designated primary in the above example is fed via WAL streaming
(`primary_conninfo`), with fallback option for file-based WAL shipping through
the `restore_command` and `barman-cloud-wal-restore`.

Cloud Native PostgreSQL allows you to define multiple replica clusters.
You can also define replica clusters with a lower number of replicas, and then
increase this number when the cluster is promoted to primary.
