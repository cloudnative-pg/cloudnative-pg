**Cloud Native PostgreSQL** is a stack designed by [2ndQuadrant](https://www.2ndquadrant.com)
to manage [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) workloads on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
particularly optimised for Private Cloud environments with Local Persistent Volumes (PV).

Cloud Native PostgreSQL defines a new Kubernetes resource called *Cluster* that
represents a PostgreSQL cluster made up of a single primary and an optional number
of replicas that co-exist in a chosen Kubernetes namespace.

PostgreSQL 13, 12, 11 and 10 are currently supported.

## Requirements

Kubernetes 1.15 or higher, tested on AWS, Google, Azure (with multiple availability zones).

## Main features

* Self-Healing capability, through:
    * failover of the primary instance, by promoting the most aligned replica
    * automated recreation of a replica
* Planned switchover of the primary instance, by promoting a selected replica
* Scale up/down capabilities
* Definition of an arbitrary number of instances (minimum 1 - one primary server)
* Definition of the *read-write* service, to connect your applications to the only primary server of the cluster
* Definition of the *read-only* service, to connect your applications to any of the instances for read workloads
* Support for Local Persistent Volumes with PVC templates
* Reuse of Persistent Volumes storage in Pods
* Rolling updates for PostgreSQL minor versions and operator upgrades
* Continuous backup to an S3 compatible object store
* Standard output logging of PostgreSQL error messages

## About this guide

Follow the instructions in the ["Quickstart"](quickstart.md) to test Cloud Native PostgreSQL
on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or Kind.

In case you are not familiar with some basic terminology on Kubernetes and PostgreSQL,
please consult the ["Before you start" section](before_you_start.md).
