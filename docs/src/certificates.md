# Certificates

To set up a Cluster, the operator needs:

- a server CA certificate
- a server TLS certificate signed by the server CA
- a client CA certificate
- a replication client certificate generated by the client CA

!!! Note
    You can find all the secrets used by the cluster and their expiration dates in the cluster's status.

## Operator managed mode

By default, the operator generates a single CA and uses it for both client and server certificates,
which are then managed and renewed automatically.

### Server CA Secret

The operator generates a self-signed CA and stores it in a generic Secret containing the following keys:

- `ca.crt`: CA certificate used to validate the server certificate, used as `sslrootcert` in clients' connection strings.
- `ca.key`: the key used to sign Server SSL certificate automatically

### Server TLS Secret

The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a server TLS certificate, stored in a
Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` and configured to be used as `ssl_cert_file` and `ssl_key_file` by the instances so
that clients can verify their identity and connect securely.

### Server alternative DNS names

The user can specify DNS server alternative names that will be part of the generated server TLS secret
in addition to the default ones.

## User-provided server certificate mode

If wanted, the user can also provide the two server certificates, generating them using a separate component,
e.g. [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).
To use a custom server TLS certificate for a Cluster, you must specify the following parameters:

- `serverTLSSecret`: the name of a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls`, containing the server TLS certificate.
  It must contain both the standard `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys.
- `serverCASecret`: the name of a Secret containing the `ca.crt` key.

!!! Note
    The operator will still create and manage the two Secrets related to client certificates.

See below for a complete example.

### Example

Given the following files:
- `server-ca.crt`: the certificate of the CA that signed the server TLS certificate.
- `server.crt`: the certificate of the server TLS certificate.
- `server.key`: the private key of the server TLS certificate.

Create a Secret containing the CA certificate:

```
kubectl create secret generic my-postgresql-server-ca --from-file=ca.crt=./server-ca.crt
```

Create a Secret with the TLS certificate:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-postgresql-server --cert=./server.crt --key=./server.key
```

Create a Cluster referencing those Secrets:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverCASecret: my-postgresql-server-ca
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgresql-server
  storage:
    storageClass: standard
    size: 1Gi
EOF
```

The new cluster will use the provided server certificates for TLS connections.

### Cert-manager Example

Here a simple example about how to use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to set up a self-signed CA and generate 
the needed TLS server certificate:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-postgres-server-cert
spec:
  secretName: my-postgres-server-cert
  usages:
    - server auth
  dnsNames:
    - cluster-example-lb.internal.mydomain.net
    - cluster-example-rw
    - cluster-example-rw.default
    - cluster-example-rw.default.svc
    - cluster-example-r
    - cluster-example-r.default
    - cluster-example-r.default.svc
    - cluster-example-ro
    - cluster-example-ro.default
    - cluster-example-ro.default.svc
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

A Secret named `my-postgres-server-cert` is created by cert-manager, containing all the needed files and can be referenced
from a Cluster as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgres-server-cert
    serverCASecret: my-postgres-server-cert
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```
