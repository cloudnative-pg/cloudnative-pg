# Certificates

Cloud Native PostgreSQL has been designed to natively support TLS certificates.
In order to set up a `Cluster`, the operator requires:

- a server Certification Authority (CA) certificate
- a server TLS certificate signed by the server Certification Authority
- a client Certification Authority certificate
- a streaming replication client certificate generated by the client Certification Authority

!!! Note
    You can find all the secrets used by the cluster and their expiration dates
    in the cluster's status.

## Operator managed mode

By default, the operator generates a single Certification Authority and uses it
for both client and server certificates, which are then managed and renewed
automatically.

### Server Certificates

#### Server CA Secret

The operator generates a self-signed CA and stores it in a generic secret
containing the following keys:

- `ca.crt`: CA certificate used to validate the server certificate, used as `sslrootcert` in clients' connection strings.
- `ca.key`: the key used to sign Server SSL certificate automatically

#### Server TLS Secret

The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a server TLS
certificate, stored in a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` and configured to
be used as `ssl_cert_file` and `ssl_key_file` by the instances so that clients
can verify their identity and connect securely.

#### Server alternative DNS names

You can specify DNS server alternative names that will be part of the
generated server TLS secret in addition to the default ones.

### Client Certificates

#### Client CA Secret

The same self-signed CA as the Server CA is used by default. The public part 
will be passed as `ssl_ca_file` to all the instances in order to be able to verify
client certificates it signed. The private key will be stored in the same secret and
used to sign Client certificates generated by the `kubectl cnp` plugin.

#### Client streaming_replica Certificate

The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a client certificate for 
the user `streaming_replica`, storing it in a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls`. 
This certificate will be passed as `sslcert` and `sslkey` in replicas' connection strings,
to allow securely connecting to the primary instance.

## User-provided certificates mode

### Server Certificates

If required, you can also provide the two server certificates, generating them
using a separate component such as [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). In
order to use a custom server TLS certificate for a Cluster, you must specify
the following parameters:

- `serverTLSSecret`: the name of a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls`,
  containing the server TLS certificate.  It must contain both the standard
  `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys.
- `serverCASecret`: the name of a Secret containing the `ca.crt` key.

!!! Note
    The operator will still create and manage the two secrets related to client
    certificates.

See below for a complete example.

#### Example

Given the following files:

- `server-ca.crt`: the certificate of the CA that signed the server TLS certificate.
- `server.crt`: the certificate of the server TLS certificate.
- `server.key`: the private key of the server TLS certificate.

Create a secret containing the CA certificate:

```
kubectl create secret generic my-postgresql-server-ca \
  --from-file=ca.crt=./server-ca.crt
```

Create a secret with the TLS certificate:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-postgresql-server \
  --cert=./server.crt --key=./server.key
```

Create a `Cluster` referencing those secrets:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverCASecret: my-postgresql-server-ca
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgresql-server
  storage:
    storageClass: standard
    size: 1Gi
EOF
```

The new cluster will use the provided server certificates for TLS connections.

#### Cert-manager Example

Here a simple example about how to use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to set up a self-signed CA and generate 
the needed TLS server certificate:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-postgres-server-cert
spec:
  secretName: my-postgres-server-cert
  usages:
    - server auth
  dnsNames:
    - cluster-example-lb.internal.mydomain.net
    - cluster-example-rw
    - cluster-example-rw.default
    - cluster-example-rw.default.svc
    - cluster-example-r
    - cluster-example-r.default
    - cluster-example-r.default.svc
    - cluster-example-ro
    - cluster-example-ro.default
    - cluster-example-ro.default.svc
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

A Secret named `my-postgres-server-cert` is created by cert-manager, containing all the needed files and can be referenced
from a Cluster as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgres-server-cert
    serverCASecret: my-postgres-server-cert
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

You can find a complete example using cert-manager to manage both server and client CA and certificates in
the [cluster-example-cert-manager.yaml](samples/cluster-example-cert-manager.yaml) deployment manifest.

### Client Certificate

If required, you can also provide the two client certificates, generating them
using a separate component such as [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) or 
[hashicorp vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/pki). In order to
use a custom CA to verify client certificates for a Cluster, you must specify
the following parameters:

- `replicationTLSSecret`: the name of a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls`,
  containing the client certificate for user `streaming_replica`. It must contain 
  both the standard `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys.
- `clientCASecret`: the name of a Secret containing the `ca.crt` key of the CA
  that should be used to verify client certificate.

!!! Note
    The operator will still create and manage the two secrets related to server
    certificates.

!!! Note
    As the Cluster is not in control of the client CA secret key, client certificates
    can not be generated using `kubectl cnp certificate` anymore.

#### Cert-manager Example

Here a simple example about how to use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to set up a self-signed CA and generate
the needed TLS server certificate:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-postgres-client-cert
spec:
  secretName: my-postgres-client-cert
  usages:
    - client auth
  commonName: streaming_replica
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

A Secret named `my-postgres-client-cert` is created by cert-manager, containing all the needed files and can be referenced
from a Cluster as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    clientCASecret: my-postgres-client-cert
    replicationTLSSecret: my-postgres-client-cert
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

You can find a complete example using cert-manager to manage both server and client CA and certificates in
the [cluster-example-cert-manager.yaml](samples/cluster-example-cert-manager.yaml) deployment manifest.
