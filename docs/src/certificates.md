# Certificates

Cloud Native PostgreSQL has been designed to natively support TLS certificates.
In order to set up a `Cluster`, the operator requires:

- a server Certification Authority (CA) certificate
- a server TLS certificate signed by the server Certification Authority
- a client Certification Authority certificate
- a streaming replication client certificate generated by the client Certification Authority

!!! Note
    You can find all the secrets used by the cluster and their expiration dates
    in the cluster's status.

## Operator managed mode

By default, the operator generates a single Certification Authority and uses it
for both client and server certificates, which are then managed and renewed
automatically.

### Server CA Secret

The operator generates a self-signed CA and stores it in a generic secret
containing the following keys:

- `ca.crt`: CA certificate used to validate the server certificate, used as `sslrootcert` in clients' connection strings.
- `ca.key`: the key used to sign Server SSL certificate automatically

### Server TLS Secret

The operator uses the generated self-signed CA to sign a server TLS
certificate, stored in a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` and configured to
be used as `ssl_cert_file` and `ssl_key_file` by the instances so that clients
can verify their identity and connect securely.

### Server alternative DNS names

You can specify DNS server alternative names that will be part of the
generated server TLS secret in addition to the default ones.

## User-provided server certificate mode

If required, you can also provide the two server certificates, generating them
using a separate component such as [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/). In
order to use a custom server TLS certificate for a Cluster, you must specify
the following parameters:

- `serverTLSSecret`: the name of a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls`,
  containing the server TLS certificate.  It must contain both the standard
  `tls.crt` and `tls.key` keys.
- `serverCASecret`: the name of a Secret containing the `ca.crt` key.

!!! Note
    The operator will still create and manage the two secrets related to client
    certificates.

See below for a complete example.

### Example

Given the following files:

- `server-ca.crt`: the certificate of the CA that signed the server TLS certificate.
- `server.crt`: the certificate of the server TLS certificate.
- `server.key`: the private key of the server TLS certificate.

Create a secret containing the CA certificate:

```
kubectl create secret generic my-postgresql-server-ca \
  --from-file=ca.crt=./server-ca.crt
```

Create a secret with the TLS certificate:

```
kubectl create secret tls my-postgresql-server \
  --cert=./server.crt --key=./server.key
```

Create a `Cluster` referencing those secrets:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverCASecret: my-postgresql-server-ca
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgresql-server
  storage:
    storageClass: standard
    size: 1Gi
EOF
```

The new cluster will use the provided server certificates for TLS connections.

### Cert-manager Example

Here a simple example about how to use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to set up a self-signed CA and generate 
the needed TLS server certificate:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-postgres-server-cert
spec:
  secretName: my-postgres-server-cert
  usages:
    - server auth
  dnsNames:
    - cluster-example-lb.internal.mydomain.net
    - cluster-example-rw
    - cluster-example-rw.default
    - cluster-example-rw.default.svc
    - cluster-example-r
    - cluster-example-r.default
    - cluster-example-r.default.svc
    - cluster-example-ro
    - cluster-example-ro.default
    - cluster-example-ro.default.svc
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

A Secret named `my-postgres-server-cert` is created by cert-manager, containing all the needed files and can be referenced
from a Cluster as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3
  certificates:
    serverTLSSecret: my-postgres-server-cert
    serverCASecret: my-postgres-server-cert
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```
