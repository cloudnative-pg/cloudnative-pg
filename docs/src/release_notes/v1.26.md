## Version 1.26.0-rc1

**Release date:** Mar 28, 2025

### Important Changes

- **CloudNativePG is now officially a CNCF project**: CloudNativePG has been
  accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), marking a
  significant milestone in its evolution. As part of this transition, the project
  is now governed under **CloudNativePG, a Series of LF Projects, LLC**, ensuring
  long-term sustainability and community-driven innovation. (#7203)

- **Deprecation of Native Barman Cloud Support**: Native support for Barman
  Cloud backups and recovery is now deprecated and will be fully removed in
  CloudNativePG 1.28.0. Users must begin migrating their existing clusters to the
  new [Barman Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud)
  to ensure a smooth transition. (#6876)

- **End of Support for Barman 3.4 and Earlier**: CloudNativePG no longer
  supports Barman versions 3.4 and earlier, including the capability detection
  framework. Users running older operand versions (from before April 2023) must
  update their operand before upgrading the operator to avoid compatibility
  issues. (#7220)

- **Hibernation Command Changes**: The `hibernate on` and `hibernate off`
  commands in the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` now serve as shortcuts for
  declarative hibernation. The previous imperative approach has been removed in
  favor of this method. Additionally, the `hibernate status` command has been
  removed, as its functionality is now covered by the standard `status`
  command. **Warning:** Do not upgrade to version 1.26 of both the plugin and
  the operator unless you are prepared to migrate to the declarative
  hibernation method. (#7155)

### Features:

- **Declarative Offline In-Place Major Upgrades of PostgreSQL**: Introduced
  support for offline in-place major upgrades when a new operand container
  image with a higher PostgreSQL major version is applied to a cluster. During
  the upgrade, all cluster pods are shut down to ensure data consistency. A new
  job is created to validate upgrade conditions, run `pg_upgrade`, and set up new
  directories for `PGDATA`, WAL files, and tablespaces as needed. Once the
  upgrade is complete, replicas are re-created. Failed upgrades can be rolled
  back declaratively. (#6664)

- **Improved Startup and Readiness Probes for Replicas**: Enhanced support for
  Kubernetes startup and readiness probes in PostgreSQL instances, providing
  greater control over replicas based on the streaming lag. (#6623)

- **Declarative management of extensions and schemas**: Introduced the
  `extensions` and `schemas` stanzas in the Database resource to declaratively
  create, modify, and drop PostgreSQL extensions and schemas within a database. (#7062)

### Enhancements

- Introduced the `STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` operator configuration setting,
  allowing users to specify the `tcp_user_timeout` parameter on all standby
  instances managed by the operator. (#7036) <!-- no 1.25 1.24 1.22 -->

- Added the `pg_extensions` metric, providing information about installed
  PostgreSQL extensions and their latest available versions. (#7195) <!-- no 1.25 1.24 1.22 -->

- Introduced the `DRAIN_TAINTS` operator configuration option, enabling users
  to customize which node taints indicate a node is being drained. This
  replaces the previous fixed behavior of only recognizing
  `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable` as a drain signal.

- Added the `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` configuration option to the operator,
  allowing users to specify the domain suffix for fully qualified domain names
  (FQDNs) generated within the Kubernetes cluster. If not set, it defaults to
  `cluster.local`. (#6989) <!-- no 1.22 -->

- Added support for LZ4, XZ, and Zstandard compression methods when archiving
  WAL files via Barman Cloud (*deprecated*). (#7151)

- Implemented the `cnpg.io/validation` annotation, enabling users to disable
  the validation webhook on CloudNativePG-managed resources. Use with caution,
  as this allows unrestricted changes. (#7196)

- Added support for patching PostgreSQL instance pods using the
  `cnpg.io/podPatch` annotation with a JSON Patch. This may introduce
  discrepancies between the operatorâ€™s expectations and Kubernetes behavior, so
  it should be used with caution. (#6323) <!-- no 1.25 1.24 1.22 -->

- Added support for collecting `pg_stat_wal` metrics in PostgreSQL 18. (#7005)

- CloudNativePG Interface (CNPG-I):

    - A plugin can now trigger instance rollouts by implementing the `EVALUATE`
      verb, ensuring that plugin-induced changes are properly reconciled. (#7126) <!-- no 1.24 1.22 -->

### Fixes

- Resolved a race condition that caused the operator to perform two switchovers
  when updating the PostgreSQL configuration. (#6991)

- Corrected the `PodMonitor` configuration by adjusting the `matchLabels` scope
  for the targeted pooler and cluster pods. Previously, the `matchLabels` were
  too broad, inadvertently inheriting labels from the cluster and leading to data
  collection from unintended targets. (#7063)

- Added a webhook warning for clusters with a missing unit (e.g., MB, GB) in
  the `shared_buffers` configuration. This will become an error in future
  releases. Users should update their configurations to include explicit units
  (e.g., `512MB` instead of `512`). (#7160)

- Treated timeout errors during volume snapshot creation as retryable to
  prevent unnecessary backup failures. (#7010) <!-- no 1.24 1.22 -->

- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Ensured that the primary Pod is recreated during an imperative restart when
      `primaryUpdateMethod` is set to `restart`, aligning its definition with the
      replicas. (#7122)

- CloudNativePG Interface (CNPG-I):
    - Implemented automatic reloading of TLS certificates for plugins when they
      change. (#7029) <!-- no 1.22 -->
    - Ensured the operator properly closes the plugin connection when
      performing a backup using the plugin. (#7095, #7096) <!-- no 1.22 -->
    - Fixed an issue that prevented WALs from being archived on a former
      primary node when using a plugin. (#6964) <!-- no 1.25 1.24 1.22 -->

### Supported versions

- Kubernetes 1.32, 1.31, and 1.30 <!-- 1.33? -->
- PostgreSQL 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13
    - PostgreSQL 17.X is the default image
    - PostgreSQL 13 support ends on November 12, 2025
