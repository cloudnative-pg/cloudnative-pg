on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.26.0-rc1

**Release date:** Mon DD, 20YY

### Important changes:

- The `hibernate on/off` commands in the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` now serve
  as shortcuts for the declarative hibernation procedure. The previously
  available imperative implementation has been removed in favor of the
  declarative approach. Additionally, the `hibernate status` command has been
  removed in favor of the standard `status` command.
  **Do not upgrade to version 1.26 of both the plugin and the operator unless
  you are prepared to migrate to the declarative method.**

### Features:

- **Improved Startup and Readiness Probes for Replicas**: Enhanced support for
  Kubernetes startup and readiness probes in PostgreSQL instances, providing
  greater control over replicas based on the streaming lag. (#6623)

- **Declarative management of extensions and schemas**: Introduced the
  `extensions` and `schemas` stanzas in the Database resource to declaratively
  create, modify, and drop PostgreSQL extensions and schemas within a database. (#7062)

- **MAIN FEATURE #1**: short description
- **MAIN FEATURE #2**: short description

### Enhancements:

- Introduced the `STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` operator configuration setting,
  which, if specified, sets the `tcp_user_timeout` parameter on all standby
  instances managed by the operator.

- Added the `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` configuration option to the operator,
  allowing users to specify the domain suffix for fully qualified domain names
  (FQDNs) generated within the Kubernetes cluster. If not set, it defaults to
  `cluster.local`. (#6989)
