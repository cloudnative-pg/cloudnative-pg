on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.19.5

**Release date:** Oct 11, 2023

!!! Warning
    Version 1.19 will reach its End-of-Life (EOL) on November 9, 2023.
    If you haven't done it yet, please start planning an upgrade
    as soon as possible.

Important Changes:

- Change the default value of `stopDelay` to 1800 seconds instead of 30 seconds
  (#2848)
- Introduce a new parameter, called `smartShutdownTimeout`, to control the
  window of time reserved for the smart shutdown of Postgres to complete; the
  general formula to compute the overall timeout to stop Postgres is
  `max(stopDelay -  smartShutdownTimeout, 30)` (#2848)
- Change the default value of `startDelay` to 3600, instead of 30 seconds
  (#2847)
- Replace the livenessProbe initial delay with a more proper Kubernetes
  startup probe to deal with the start of a Postgres server (#2847)
- Change the default value of `switchoverDelay` to 3600 seconds instead of
  40000000 seconds (#2846)
- Stop supporting the `postgresql` label - replaced by `cnpg.io/cluster` in
  1.18 (#2744)

Security:

- Add a default `seccompProfile` to the operator deployment (#2926)

Enhancements:

- Introduce the `cnpg.io/coredumpFilter` annotation to control the content of a
  core dump generated in the unlikely event of a PostgreSQL crash, by default
  set to exclude shared memory segments from the dump (#2733)
- Allow to configure ephemeral-storage limits for the shared memory and
  temporary data ephemeral volumes (#2830)
- Validate resource limits and requests through the webhook (#2663)
- Ensure that PostgreSQL's `shared_buffers` are coherent with the pods'
  allocated memory resources (#2840)
- Add `uri` and `jdbc-uri` fields in the credential secrets to facilitate
  developers when connecting their applications to the database (#2186)
- Add a new phase `Waiting for the instances to become active` for finer
  control of a cluster's state waiting for the replicas to be ready (#2612)
- Improve detection of Pod rollout conditions through the `podSpec` annotation
  (#2243)
- Add primary timestamp and uptime to the kubectl plugin's `status` command
  (#2953)

Fixes:

- Ensure that the primary instance is always recreated first by prioritizing
  ready PVCs with a primary role (#2544)
- Honor the `cnpg.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck` annotation during recovery to
  bypass the check for an empty WAL archive (#2731)
- Prevent a cluster from being stuck when the PostgreSQL server is down but the
  pod is up on the primary (#2966)
- Avoid treating the designated primary in a replica cluster as a regular HA
  replica when replication slots are enabled (#2960)
- Reconcile services every time the selectors change or when labels/annotations
  need to be changed (#2918)
- Defaults to `app` both the owner and database during recovery bootstrap
  (#2957)
- Avoid write-read concurrency on cached cluster (#2884)
- Remove empty items, make them unique and sort in the `ResourceName` sections
  of the generated roles (#2875)
- Ensure that the `ContinuousArchiving` condition is properly set to 'failed'
  in case of errors (#2625)
- Make the `Backup` resource reconciliation cycle more resilient on
  interruptions by stopping only if the backup is completed or failed (#2591)
- Reconcile PodMonitor `labels` and `annotations` (#2583)
- Fix backup failure due to missing RBAC `resourceNames` on the `Role` object
  (#2956)
- Observability:

    - Add TCP port label to default `pg_stat_replication` metric (#2961)
    - Fix the `pg_wal_stat` default metric for Prometheus (#2569)
    - Improve the `pg_replication` default metric for Prometheus (#2744 and
      #2750)
    - Use `alertInstanceLabelFilter` instead of `alertName` in the provided
      Grafana dashboard
    - Enforce `standard_conforming_strings` in metric collection (#2888)

Changes:

- Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 16.0
- Fencing now uses PostgreSQL's fast shutdown instead of smart shutdown to halt
  an instance (#3051)
- Rename webhooks from kb.io to cnpg.io group (#2851)
- Let the `cnpg hibernate` plugin command use the
  `ClusterManifestAnnotationName` and `PgControldataAnnotationName` annotations
  on PVCs (#2657)
- Add the `cnpg.io/instanceRole` label while deprecating the existing `role`
  label (#2915)

Technical enhancements:

- Replace `k8s-api-docgen` with `gen-crd-api-reference-docs` to automatically
  build the API reference documentation (#2606)

## Version 1.19.4

**Release date:** July 27, 2023

- Various enhancements to the documentation:
    - Add troubleshooting instructions relating to hugepages (#1390)
    - Extend the FAQs page (#2344)

Technical enhancements:

- Add a check at the start of the restore process to ensure it can proceed; give
  improved error diagnostics if it cannot (#2419)

Fixes:

- Ensure the logic of setting the recovery target matches that of Postgres (#2460)
- Prevent taking over service accounts not owned by the cluster, by setting
  ownerMetadata only during service account creation (#2462)
- Ensure correct permissions of the PGDATA directory for initdb and restore (#2384)
- Prevent a possible crash of the instance manager during the configuration reload (#2393)
- Prevent the LastFailedArchiveTime alert from triggering if a new backup has been
  successful after the failed ones (#1751)
- Prevent services from targeting non-instance pods (#2336)

Security:

- Updated all project dependencies to the latest versions

## Version 1.19.3

**Release date:** June 12, 2023

Enhancements:

- Add the `snapshot` command to the `cnpg` plugin to create a consistent cold
  backup of the cluster from a standby using the Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot`
  standard resource (#1960)
- First implementation of recovery from a set of CSI VolumeSnapshot resources
  via the `.spec.bootstrap.recovery.volumeSnapshot` stanza (#1960)
- Add `pg_failover_slots` to managed extensions (#2057)
- Improved Grafana dashboard with updated instructions in the documentation and
  the quickstart guide (#1916)
- Introduce the `schemaOnly` option in the `import` stanza, to avoid exporting
  and importing data when you bootstrap a new Postgres Cluster from one or more
  existing databases (#2234)
- Add support for TopologySpreadConstraints to manage scheduling of instance
  pods (#2202)
- Add `PodMonitor` support to the `Pooler`for PgBouncer (#2034)

- Use PgBouncer 1.19 by default (#2018)

Technical enhancements:

- Updated k8s kind tested versions (#2054)
- Use separate transactions to reconcile role credentials. Before this patch,
  the operator would revert the synchronization of all roles if one failed
  (#2004)
- Ensure fencing is removed during cluster restore (#1987)
- Improve logging when deleting Pods (#2136)

Fixes:

- Fix unbound variable with k3d engine which could prevent setup on k3d (#2157)
- Report the correct PG version in the metrics (#2126)
- Use the correct walStorage key in the documentation (#2140)
- Halt reconciliation when the operator cannot connect with the instances, and
  provide a clear diagnostic on such occasions. This will help clarify cases
  where network issues obstruct normal operation of CloudNativePG (#2145),
  (#2233), and (#2242)

## Version 1.19.2

**Release date:** April 27, 2023

Enhancements:

- Improve the `--logs` option of the `report` command of the `cnpg` plugin for

Security:

- Enable customization of `SeccompProfile` through override via a local file (#1827)

Fixes:

- Apply the PostgreSQL configuration provided by the user during the `initdb`
  bootstrap phase, before the server is started the first time (#1858)

## Version 1.19.1

**Release date:** March 20, 2023

Enhancements:

- Enhance observability of backups with two new metrics and additional
  information in the status (#1428)
- Document API calls from the instance manager (#1641)
- Clarify deployment name via Helm (#1505)
- Add the `psql` command to the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` (#1668) allowing
  the user to start a `psql` session with a pod (the primary by default)

Technical enhancements:

- Adopt Renovate for dependency tracking/updating (#1367, #1473)
- Inject binaries for all supported architectures in the operator image (#1513)
- Use the backup name to match resources in the backup object store (#1650)
  Leverages the `--name` option introduced with Barman 3.3 to make the
  association between backups and the object store more robust.

- Ensure `nodeAffinity` is applied even if `AdditionalPodAffinity` and
  `AdditionalPodAntiAffinity` are not set (#1663)
- Introduce failover delay during OnlineUpgrading phase (#1728)
  Previously, the online upgrade process could trigger failover logic
  unnecessarily.
