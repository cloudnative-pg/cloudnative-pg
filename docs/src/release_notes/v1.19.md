on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.19.2

**Release date:** April 27, 2023

Enhancements:

- Improve the `--logs` option of the `report` command of the `cnpg` plugin for
  `kubectl` to also include the previous logs where available (#1811)
- The `-any` service is now disabled by default (#1755)

Security:

- Enable customization of `SeccompProfile` through override via a local file (#1827)

Fixes:

- Apply the PostgreSQL configuration provided by the user during the `initdb`
  bootstrap phase, before the server is started the first time (#1858)

## Version 1.19.1

**Release date:** March 20, 2023

Enhancements:

- Allow overriding the default backup target policy (#1602): previously, all
  backups and scheduled backups would use the cluster-level target policy
- Extend the `debug` cluster's log level to the `initdb` job (#1503)
- Support IPv6 and custom `pg_hba` for the PgBouncer pooler (#1395)
- Enhance observability of backups with two new metrics and additional
  information in the status (#1428)
- Document API calls from the instance manager (#1641)
- Clarify deployment name via Helm (#1505)
- Add the `psql` command to the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` (#1668) allowing
  the user to start a `psql` session with a pod (the primary by default)

Technical enhancements:

- Adopt Renovate for dependency tracking/updating (#1367, #1473)
- Inject binaries for all supported architectures in the operator image (#1513)
- Use the backup name to match resources in the backup object store (#1650)
  Leverages the `--name` option introduced with Barman 3.3 to make the
  association between backups and the object store more robust.

Fixes:

- Prevent panic with error handling in the probes (#1716)
- Ensure that the HTTP package and controller runtime logs are in JSON format (#1442)
- Adds WAL storage to a cluster in a single instance Cluster (#1570)
- Various improvements to make backup code more robust (#1536, #1564, #1588, #1466,  #1647)
- Properly show WAL archiving information with `status` command of the `cnpg` plugin (#1666)
- Ensure `nodeAffinity` is applied even if `AdditionalPodAffinity` and
  `AdditionalPodAntiAffinity` are not set (#1663)
- Introduce failover delay during OnlineUpgrading phase (#1728)
  Previously, the online upgrade process could trigger failover logic
  unnecessarily.

## Version 1.19.0

**Release date:** Feb 14, 2023

Important announcements:

- PostgreSQL version 10 is no longer supported as it has reached its EOL.
  Versions 11 and newer are supported. Please plan your migration to
  PostgreSQL 15 as soon as possible. Refer to
  ["Importing Postgres databases"](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/database_import/)
  for more information on PostgreSQL major offline upgrades.

Features:

- Backup from a standby: introduce the `.spec.backup.target` option accepting
  that when set to `prefer-standby` will run take the physical base backup from
  the most aligned replica (#1162)
- Delayed failover: introduce the `failoverDelay` parameter to delay the
  failover process once the primary has been detected unhealthy (#1366)

Enhancements:

- Introduce support for Kubernetes' projected volumes (#1269)
- Introduce support custom environment variables for finer control of the
  PostgreSQL server process (#1275)
- Introduce the `backup` command in the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` to
  issue a new base backup of the cluster (#1348)
- Improve support for the separate WAL volume feature by enabling users to move
  WAL files to a dedicated volume on an existing Postgres cluster (#1066)
- Enhance WAL observability with additional metrics for the Prometheus
  exporter, including values equivalent to the `min_wal_size`, `max_wal_size`,
  `keep_wal_size`, `wal_keep_segments`, as well as the maximum number of WALs
  that can be stored in the dedicated volume (#1382)
- Add a database comment on the `streaming_replica` user (#1349)
- Document the firewall issues with webhooks on GKE (#1364)
- Add note about postgresql.conf in `recovery` (#1211)
- Add instructions on installing plugin using packages (#1357)
- Specify Postgres versions supported by each minor release (#1355)
- Clarify the meaning of PVC group in CloudNativePG (#1344)
- Add an example of the DigitalOcean S3-compatible Spaces (#1289)
- Update default PostgreSQL version for new cluster definitions to 15.2 (#1430)
- Cover the Kubernetes layer in greater detail in the Architecture
  documentation (#1432)

Technical enhancements:

- Added daily end-to-end smoke test for release branches (#1235)

Fixes:

- Skip executing a `CHECKPOINT` as the `streaming_replica` user (#1408)
- Make `waitForWalArchiveWorking` resilient to connection errors (#1399)
- Ensure that the PVC roles are always consistent (#1380)
- Permit `walStorage` resize when using `pvcTemplate` (#1315)
- Ensure `ExecCommand` obeys timeout (#1242)
- Avoid `PodMonitor` reconcile if Prometheus is not installed (#1238)
