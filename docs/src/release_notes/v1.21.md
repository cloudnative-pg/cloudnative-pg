## Version 1.21.0

**Release date:** Oct 12, 2023

!!! Important "Important changes from previous versions"
    This release contains a few changes to the default settings of
    CloudNativePG with the goal to improve general stability and security through
    predefined values. If you are upgrading from a previous version, please
    carefully read the "Important Changes" section below, as well as the
    [upgrade documentation](installation_upgrade.md).

Features:

- **Volume Snapshot support for backup and recovery:** leverage the standard
  Kubernetes API on Volume Snapshots to take advantage of capabilities like
  incremental and differential copy for both backup and recovery operations. This
  first step, covering cold backups from a standby, will continue in 1.22 with
  support for hot backups using the PostgreSQL API and tablespaces.

- **OLM installation method**: introduce support for Operator Lifecycle Manager
  via OperatorHub.io for the latest patch version of the latest minor release
  through the *stable* channel. Many thanks to EDB for donating the bundle of
  their "EDB Postgres for Kubernetes" operator and adapting it for CloudNativePG.

Important Changes:

- Change the default value of `stopDelay` to 1800 seconds instead of 30 seconds
  (#2848)
- Introduce a new parameter, called `smartShutdownTimeout`, to control the
  window of time reserved for the smart shutdown of Postgres to complete; the
  general formula to compute the overall timeout to stop Postgres is
  `max(stopDelay -  smartShutdownTimeout, 30)` (#2848)
- Change the default value of `startDelay` to 3600, instead of 30 seconds
  (#2847)
- Replace the livenessProbe initial delay with a more proper Kubernetes
  startup probe to deal with the start of a Postgres server (#2847)
- Change the default value of `switchoverDelay` to 3600 seconds instead of
  40000000 seconds (#2846)
- Disable superuser access by default for security (#2905)
- Enable replication slots for HA by default (#2903)
- Stop supporting the `postgresql` label - replaced by `cnpg.io/cluster` in
  1.18 (#2744)

Security:

- Add a default `seccompProfile` to the operator deployment (#2926)

Enhancements:

- Enable bootstrap of a replica cluster from a consistent set of volume
  snapshots (#2647)
- Enable full and Point In Time recovery from a consistent set of volume
  snapshots (#2390)
- Introduce the `cnpg.io/coredumpFilter` annotation to control the content of a
  core dump generated in the unlikely event of a PostgreSQL crash, by default
  set to exclude shared memory segments from the dump (#2733)
- Allow to configure ephemeral-storage limits for the shared memory and
  temporary data ephemeral volumes (#2830)
- Validate resource limits and requests through the webhook (#2663)
- Ensure that PostgreSQL's `shared_buffers` are coherent with the pods'
  allocated memory resources (#2840)
- Add `uri` and `jdbc-uri` fields in the credential secrets to facilitate
  developers when connecting their applications to the database (#2186)
- Add a new phase `Waiting for the instances to become active` for finer
  control of a cluster's state waiting for the replicas to be ready (#2612)
- Improve detection of Pod rollout conditions through the `podSpec` annotation
  (#2243)
- Add primary timestamp and uptime to the kubectl plugin's `status` command
  (#2953)

Fixes:

- Ensure that the primary instance is always recreated first by prioritizing
  ready PVCs with a primary role (#2544)
- Honor the `cnpg.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck` annotation during recovery to
  bypass the check for an empty WAL archive (#2731)
- Prevent a cluster from being stuck when the PostgreSQL server is down but the
  pod is up on the primary (#2966)
- Avoid treating the designated primary in a replica cluster as a regular HA
  replica when replication slots are enabled (#2960)
- Reconcile services every time the selectors change or when labels/annotations
  need to be changed (#2918)
- Defaults to `app` both the owner and database during recovery bootstrap
  (#2957)
- Avoid write-read concurrency on cached cluster (#2884)
- Remove empty items, make them unique and sort in the `ResourceName` sections
  of the generated roles (#2875)
- Ensure that the `ContinuousArchiving` condition is properly set to 'failed'
  in case of errors (#2625)
- Make the `Backup` resource reconciliation cycle more resilient on
  interruptions by stopping only if the backup is completed or failed (#2591)
- Reconcile PodMonitor `labels` and `annotations` (#2583)
- Fix backup failure due to missing RBAC `resourceNames` on the `Role` object
  (#2956)
- Observability:

    - Add TCP port label to default `pg_stat_replication` metric (#2961)
    - Fix the `pg_wal_stat` default metric for Prometheus (#2569)
    - Improve the `pg_replication` default metric for Prometheus (#2744 and
      #2750)
    - Use `alertInstanceLabelFilter` instead of `alertName` in the provided
      Grafana dashboard
    - Enforce `standard_conforming_strings` in metric collection (#2888)

Changes:

- Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 16.0
- Fencing now uses PostgreSQL's fast shutdown instead of smart shutdown to halt
  an instance (#3051)
- Rename webhooks from kb.io to cnpg.io group (#2851)
- Replace the `cnpg snapshot` command with `cnpg backup -m volumeSnapshot` for
  the `kubectl` plugin
- Let the `cnpg hibernate` plugin command use the
  `ClusterManifestAnnotationName` and `PgControldataAnnotationName` annotations
  on PVCs (#2657)
- Add the `cnpg.io/instanceRole` label while deprecating the existing `role`
  label (#2915)

Technical enhancements:

- Replace `k8s-api-docgen` with `gen-crd-api-reference-docs` to automatically
  build the API reference documentation (#2606)
