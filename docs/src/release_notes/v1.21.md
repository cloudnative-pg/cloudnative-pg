## Version 1.21.3

**Release date:** Feb 1, 2024

Enhancements:

- Tailor ephemeral volume storage in a Postgres cluster using a claim template
  through the `ephemeralVolumeSource` option (#3678)
- Introduce the `pgadmin4` command in the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl`,
  providing a straightforward method to demonstrate connecting to a given
  database cluster and navigate its content in a local environment such as kind -
  for evaluation purposes only (#3701)
- Allow customization of PostgreSQL's ident map file via the
  `.spec.postgresql.pg_ident` stanza, through a list of user name maps (#3534)

Fixes:

- Prevent an unrecoverable issue with `pg_rewind` failing due to
  `postgresql.auto.conf` being read-only on clusters where the `ALTER SYSTEM`
  SQL command is disabled - the default (#3728)
- Reduce the risk of disk space shortage when using the import facility of the
  `initdb` bootstrap method, by optimizing the PostgreSQL instance for the sole
  duration of the import process (#3743)
- Avoid pod restart due to erroneous resource quantity comparisons, e.g. "1 !=
  1000m"  (#3706)
- Properly escape reserved characters in `pgpass` connection fields (#3713)
- Prevent systematic rollout of pods due to considering zero and nil different
  values in `.spec.projectedVolumeTemplate.sources` (#3647)

## Version 1.21.2

**Release date:** Dec 21, 2023

Security:

- By default, TLSv1.3 is now enforced on all PostgreSQL 12 or higher
  installations. Additionally, users can configure the `ssl_ciphers`,
  `ssl_min_protocol_version`, and `ssl_max_protocol_version` GUCs (#3408).
- Integration of Docker image scanning with Dockle and Snyk to enhance security
  measures (#3300).

Enhancements:

- Improved reconciliation of external clusters (#3533).
- Introduction of the ability to enable/disable the `ALTER SYSTEM` command (#3535).
- Support for Prometheus' dynamic relabeling through the
  `podMonitorMetricRelabelings` and `podMonitorRelabelings` options in the
  `.spec.monitoring` stanza of the `Cluster` and `Pooler` resources (#3075).
- Enhanced computation of the first recoverability point and last successful
  backup by considering volume snapshots alongside object-store backups (#2940). <!-- NO 1.20 -->
- Elimination of the use of the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable when
  establishing a network connection to PostgreSQL (#3522).
- Improved `cnpg report` plugin command by collecting a cluster's PVCs (#3357).
- Enhancement of the `cnpg status` plugin command, providing information about
  managed roles, including alerts (#3310).
- Introduction of Red Hat UBI 8 container images for the operator, suitable for
  OLM deployments. <!-- NO 1.20 -->
- Connection pooler:
    - Scaling down instances of a `Pooler` resource to 0 is now possible (#3517).
    - Addition of the `cnpg.io/podRole` label with a value of 'pooler' to every
      pooler deployment, differentiating them from instance pods (#3396).

Fixes:

- Reconciliation of metadata, annotations, and labels of `PodDisruptionBudget`
  resources (#3312 and #3434).
- Reconciliation of the metadata of the managed credential secrets (#3316).
- Resolution of a bug in the backup snapshot code where an error reading the
  body would be handled as an overall error, leaving the backup process
  indefinitely stuck (#3321).
- Implicit setting of online backup with the `cnpg backup` plugin command when
  either `immediate-checkpoint` or `wait-for-archive` options are requested (#3449).
- Disabling of wal_sender_timeout when joining through pg_basebackup (#3586)
- Reloading of secrets used by external clusters (#3565)
- Connection pooler:
    - Ensuring the controller watches all secrets owned by a `Pooler` resource (#3428).
    - Reconciliation of `RoleBinding` for `Pooler` resources (#3391).
    - Reconciliation of `imagePullSecret` for `Pooler` resources (#3389).
    - Reconciliation of the service of a `Pooler` and addition of the required labels (#3349).
    - Extension of `Pooler` labels to the deployment as well, not just the pods (#3350).

Changes:

- Default operand image set to PostgreSQL 16.1 (#3270).

## Version 1.21.1

**Release date:** Nov 3, 2023

Enhancements:

- Introduce support for online/hot backups with volume snapshots by using the
  PostgreSQL API for physical online base backups. Default configuration for
  hot/cold backups on a given Postgres cluster can be controlled through the
  `online` option and the `onlineConfiguration` stanza in
  `.spec.backup.volumeSnapshot`. Unless explicitly set, backups on volume
  snapshots are now taken online by default (#3102)
- Introduce the possibility to override the above default settings on volume
  snapshot backup using the `ScheduledBackup` and `Backup` resources (#3208, #3226)
- Enhance cold backup on volume snapshots by reducing the time window in which
  the target instance (standby or primary) is fenced, by lifting it as soon as
  the volume snapshot have been cut and provisioned (#3210)
- During a recovery from volume snapshots, ensure that the provided volume
  snapshots are coherent by validating the existing labels and annotations
- The `backup` command of the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` improves the volume
  snapshot backup experience through the `--online`, `--immediate-checkpoint`,
  and `--wait-for-archive` runtime options
- Enhance the `status` command of the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` with progress
  information on active streaming base backups (#3101)
- Allow the configuration of `max_prepared_statements` with the pgBouncer
  `Pooler` resource (#3174)

Fixes:

- Suspend WAL archiving during a switchover and resume it when it is completed
  (#3227)
- Ensure that the instance manager always uses `synchronous_commit = local`
  when managing the PostgreSQL cluster (#3143)
- Custom certificates for streaming replication user through
  `.spec.certificates.replicationTLSSecret` are now working (#3209)
- Set the `cnpg.io/cluster` label to the `Pooler` pods (#3153)
- Reduce the number of labels in `VolumeSnapshots` resources and render them
  into more appropriate annotations (#3151)

Changes:

- Volume snapshot backups, introduced in 1.21.0, are now online/hot by default;
  in order to restore offline/cold backups set `.spec.backup.volumeSnapshot` to
  `false`
- Stop using the `postgresql.auto.conf` file inside PGDATA to control Postgres
  replication settings, and replace it with a file named `override.conf` (#2812)

Technical enhancements:

- Use extended query protocol for PostgreSQL in the instance manager (#3152)

## Version 1.21.0

**Release date:** Oct 12, 2023

!!! Important "Important changes from previous versions"
    This release contains a few changes to the default settings of
    CloudNativePG with the goal to improve general stability and security through
    predefined values. If you are upgrading from a previous version, please
    carefully read the "Important Changes" section below, as well as the
    [upgrade documentation](../installation_upgrade.md).

Features:

- **Volume Snapshot support for backup and recovery:** leverage the standard
  Kubernetes API on Volume Snapshots to take advantage of capabilities like
  incremental and differential copy for both backup and recovery operations. This
  first step, covering cold backups from a standby, will continue in 1.22 with
  support for hot backups using the PostgreSQL API and tablespaces.

- **OLM installation method**: introduce support for Operator Lifecycle Manager
  via OperatorHub.io for the latest patch version of the latest minor release
  through the *stable* channel. Many thanks to EDB for donating the bundle of
  their "EDB Postgres for Kubernetes" operator and adapting it for CloudNativePG.

Important Changes:

- Change the default value of `stopDelay` to 1800 seconds instead of 30 seconds
  (#2848)
- Introduce a new parameter, called `smartShutdownTimeout`, to control the
  window of time reserved for the smart shutdown of Postgres to complete; the
  general formula to compute the overall timeout to stop Postgres is
  `max(stopDelay -  smartShutdownTimeout, 30)` (#2848)
- Change the default value of `startDelay` to 3600, instead of 30 seconds
  (#2847)
- Replace the livenessProbe initial delay with a more proper Kubernetes
  startup probe to deal with the start of a Postgres server (#2847)
- Change the default value of `switchoverDelay` to 3600 seconds instead of
  40000000 seconds (#2846)
- Disable superuser access by default for security (#2905)
- Enable replication slots for HA by default (#2903)
- Stop supporting the `postgresql` label - replaced by `cnpg.io/cluster` in
  1.18 (#2744)

Security:

- Add a default `seccompProfile` to the operator deployment (#2926)

Enhancements:

- Enable bootstrap of a replica cluster from a consistent set of volume
  snapshots (#2647)
- Enable full and Point In Time recovery from a consistent set of volume
  snapshots (#2390)
- Introduce the `cnpg.io/coredumpFilter` annotation to control the content of a
  core dump generated in the unlikely event of a PostgreSQL crash, by default
  set to exclude shared memory segments from the dump (#2733)
- Allow to configure ephemeral-storage limits for the shared memory and
  temporary data ephemeral volumes (#2830)
- Validate resource limits and requests through the webhook (#2663)
- Ensure that PostgreSQL's `shared_buffers` are coherent with the pods'
  allocated memory resources (#2840)
- Add `uri` and `jdbc-uri` fields in the credential secrets to facilitate
  developers when connecting their applications to the database (#2186)
- Add a new phase `Waiting for the instances to become active` for finer
  control of a cluster's state waiting for the replicas to be ready (#2612)
- Improve detection of Pod rollout conditions through the `podSpec` annotation
  (#2243)
- Add primary timestamp and uptime to the kubectl plugin's `status` command
  (#2953)

Fixes:

- Ensure that the primary instance is always recreated first by prioritizing
  ready PVCs with a primary role (#2544)
- Honor the `cnpg.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck` annotation during recovery to
  bypass the check for an empty WAL archive (#2731)
- Prevent a cluster from being stuck when the PostgreSQL server is down but the
  pod is up on the primary (#2966)
- Avoid treating the designated primary in a replica cluster as a regular HA
  replica when replication slots are enabled (#2960)
- Reconcile services every time the selectors change or when labels/annotations
  need to be changed (#2918)
- Defaults to `app` both the owner and database during recovery bootstrap
  (#2957)
- Avoid write-read concurrency on cached cluster (#2884)
- Remove empty items, make them unique and sort in the `ResourceName` sections
  of the generated roles (#2875)
- Ensure that the `ContinuousArchiving` condition is properly set to 'failed'
  in case of errors (#2625)
- Make the `Backup` resource reconciliation cycle more resilient on
  interruptions by stopping only if the backup is completed or failed (#2591)
- Reconcile PodMonitor `labels` and `annotations` (#2583)
- Fix backup failure due to missing RBAC `resourceNames` on the `Role` object
  (#2956)
- Observability:

    - Add TCP port label to default `pg_stat_replication` metric (#2961)
    - Fix the `pg_wal_stat` default metric for Prometheus (#2569)
    - Improve the `pg_replication` default metric for Prometheus (#2744 and
      #2750)
    - Use `alertInstanceLabelFilter` instead of `alertName` in the provided
      Grafana dashboard
    - Enforce `standard_conforming_strings` in metric collection (#2888)

Changes:

- Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 16.0
- Fencing now uses PostgreSQL's fast shutdown instead of smart shutdown to halt
  an instance (#3051)
- Rename webhooks from kb.io to cnpg.io group (#2851)
- Replace the `cnpg snapshot` command with `cnpg backup -m volumeSnapshot` for
  the `kubectl` plugin
- Let the `cnpg hibernate` plugin command use the
  `ClusterManifestAnnotationName` and `PgControldataAnnotationName` annotations
  on PVCs (#2657)
- Add the `cnpg.io/instanceRole` label while deprecating the existing `role`
  label (#2915)

Technical enhancements:

- Replace `k8s-api-docgen` with `gen-crd-api-reference-docs` to automatically
  build the API reference documentation (#2606)
