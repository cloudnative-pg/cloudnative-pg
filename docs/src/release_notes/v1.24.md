on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.24.0

**Release date:** Aug 22, 2024

### Important changes:

- Deprecate the `role` label in the selectors of `Service` and
  `PodDisruptionBudget` resources in favor of `cnpg.io/instanceRole` (#4897).
- Fix the default PodAntiAffinity configuration for PostgreSQL Pods,
  allowing a PostgreSQL and a Pooler Instance to coexist on the same node when
  the anti-affinity configuration is set to `required` (#5156).

!!! Warning
    The PodAntiAffinity change will trigger a rollout of all the instances when
    the operator is upgraded, even when online upgrades are enabled.

### Features:

- **Distributed PostgreSQL Topologies**: Enhance the replica cluster feature to
  create distributed database topologies for PostgreSQL that span multiple
  Kubernetes clusters, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. This feature
  supports:
    - **Declarative Primary Control**: Easily specify which PostgreSQL cluster
      acts as the primary in a distributed setup (#4388).
    - **Seamless Switchover**: Effortlessly demote the current primary and
      promote a selected replica cluster, typically in a different region,
      without needing to rebuild the former primary. This ensures high availability
      and resilience in diverse environments (#4411).
- **Managed Services**: Introduce managed services via the `managed.services`
  stanza (#4769 and #4952), allowing you to:
    - Disable the read-only and read services via configuration.
    - Leverage the service template capability to create custom service
      resources, including load balancers, to access PostgreSQL outside
      Kubernetes (particularly useful for DBaaS purposes).
- **Enhanced API for Synchronous Replication**: Introducing an improved API for
  explicit configuration of synchronous replication, supporting both
  quorum-based and priority list strategies. This update allows full
  customization of the `synchronous_standby_names` option, providing greater
  control and flexibility (#5148).
- **WAL Disk Space Exhaustion**: Safely stop the cluster when PostgreSQL runs
  out of disk space to store WAL files, making recovery easier by increasing
  the size of the related volume (#4404).

### Enhancements:

- Add support for delayed replicas by introducing the
  `.spec.replica.minApplyDelay` option, leveraging PostgreSQL's
  `recovery_min_apply_delay` capability (#5181).
- Introduce `postInitSQLRefs` and `postInitTemplateSQLRefs` to allow users to
  define `postInit` and `postInitTemplate` instructions as one or more config
  maps or secrets (#5074).
- Add transparent support for PostgreSQL 17's `allow_alter_system` parameter,
  enabling or disabling the `ALTER SYSTEM` command through the
`.spec.postgresql.enableAlterSystem` option (#4921).
- Allow overriding the query metric name and the names of the columns using a
  `name` key/value pair, which can replace the name automatically inherited
  from the parent key (#4779).
- Enhanced control over exported metrics by making them subject to the value
  returned by a custom query, which is run within the same transaction and
  defined in the `predicate_query` field (#4503).
- Allow additional arguments to be passed to `barman-cloud-wal-archive` and
  `barman-cloud-wal-restore` (#5099).
- Introduce the `reconcilePodSpec` annotation on the `Cluster` and `Pooler`
  resources to control the restart of pods following a change in the Pod
  specification (#5069).
- The readiness probe now fails for streaming replicas that were
  never connected to the primary instance, allowing incoherent replicas
  to be discovered promptly (#5206).
- Support the new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.23 in the `Pooler` metrics
  collector (#5044).
- `cnpg` plugin updates:
    - Enhance the `install generate` command by adding a `--control-plane` option,
      allowing deployment of the operator on control-plane nodes by setting
      node affinity and tolerations (#5271).
    - Enhance the `destroy` command to delete also any job related to the target
      instance (#5298).
    - Enhanced the `status` command to display `demotionToken` and
      `promotionToken` when available, providing more detailed operational
      insights with distributed topologies (#5149).
    - Added support for customizing the remote database name in the `publication`
      and `subscription` subcommands. This enhancement offers greater flexibility
      for synchronizing data from an external cluster with multiple databases (#5113).

### Security:

- Add TLS communication between the operator and instance manager (#4442).
- Add optional TLS communication for the instance metrics exporter (#4927).

### Fixes:

- Enhance the mechanism for detecting Pods that have been terminated but not
  deleted during an eviction process, and extend the cleanup process during
  maintenance windows to include unschedulable Pods when the `reusePVC` flag is
  set to false (#2056).
- Disable `pg_rewind` execution for newly created replicas that employ
  VolumeSnapshot during bootstrapping to avoid introducing a new shutdown
  checkpoint entry in the WAL files. This ensures that replicas can reconnect to
  the primary without issues, which would otherwise be hindered by the additional
  checkpoint entry (#5081).
- Gracefully handle failures during the initialization of a new instance.
  Any remaining data from the failed initialization is now either removed or,
  if it's a valid PostgreSQL data directory, moved to a backup location to avoid
  possible data loss (#5112).
- Enhance the robustness of the immediate backups reconciler by implementing
  retry logic upon initial backup failure (#4982).
- Wait for the `postmaster` to shut down before starting it again (#4938).
- Ensure that the `Pooler` service template can override the default service
  (#4846).
- Exclude immutable databases from `pg_database` metric monitoring and alerting
  processes (#4980).
- Removed unnecessary permissions from the operator service account (#4911).
- Fix cluster role permissions for `ClusterImageCatalogs` (#5034).
- Ensure the operator initiates a rollout of the `Pooler` instance when
  the operator image is upgraded (#5006)
- Address race condition causing the readiness probe to incorrectly
  show "not ready" after a PostgreSQL restart, even when the
  `postmaster` was accessible (#4920).
- Prevent reconciliation of resources that aren't owned by a `Pooler` (#4967).
- Renew the certificates managed by the operator when the DNS Subject
  Alternative Names (SANs) are updated (#3269, #3319).
- Set PVC default `AccessModes` in the template only when unspecified (#4845).
- Gracefully handle unsatisfiable backup schedule (#5109).
- Synchronous replication self-healing checks now exclude terminated pods,
  focusing only on active and functional pods (#5210).
- The instance manager will now terminate all existing operator-related replication
  connections following a role change in a replica cluster (#5209).
- Allow setting `smartShutdownTimeout` to zero, enabling immediate fast
  shutdown and bypassing the smart shutdown process when required (#5347).
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Properly handle errors during the `status` command execution.
    - Support TLS in the `status` command (#4915).
