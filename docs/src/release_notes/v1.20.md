on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.20.1

**Release date:** June 12, 2023

Enhancements:

- Add the `snapshot` command to the `cnpg` plugin to create a consistent cold
  backup of the cluster from a standby using the Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot`
  standard resource (#1960)
- First implementation of recovery from a set of CSI VolumeSnapshot resources
  via the `.spec.bootstrap.recovery.volumeSnapshot` stanza (#1960)
- Add `pg_failover_slots` to managed extensions (#2057)
- Improved Grafana dashboard with updated instructions in the documentation and
  the quickstart guide (#1916)
- Introduce the `schemaOnly` option in the `import` stanza, to avoid exporting
  and importing data when you bootstrap a new Postgres Cluster from one or more
  existing databases (#2234)
- Add support for TopologySpreadConstraints to manage scheduling of instance
  pods (#2202)
- Add `PodMonitor` support to the `Pooler`for PgBouncer (#2034)
- Add option to override the default Kubernetes scheduler (#2013)
- Allow configuration of deployment strategy of a `Pooler` resource (#1983)
- Update default PostgreSQL version to 15.3 (#2022)
- Use PgBouncer 1.19 by default (#2018)

Technical enhancements:

- Updated k8s kind tested versions (#2054)
- Declarative roles should ignore passwords if not set, easing management of
  previously existing roles  (#2029)
- Use separate transactions to reconcile role credentials. Before this patch,
  the operator would revert the synchronization of all roles if one failed
  (#2004)
- Ensure fencing is removed during cluster restore (#1987)
- Improve logging when deleting Pods (#2136)

Fixes:

- Fix unbound variable with k3s engine which could prevent setup on K3â€™s (#2157)
- Report the correct PG version in the metrics (#2126)
- Use the correct walStorage key in the documentation (#2140)
- Halt reconciliation when the operator cannot connect with the instances, and
  provide a clear diagnostic on such occasions. This will help clarify cases
  where network issues obstruct normal operation of CloudNativePG (#2145),
  (#2233), and (#2242)

## Version 1.20.0

**Release date:** April 27, 2023

!!! Important "Important changes from previous versions"
    CloudNativePG 1.20 introduces some changes to the default behavior of a
    few features for newly created `Cluster` resources, compared to previous
    versions of the operator. The goal of these changes is to improve the
    resilience of a Postgres cluster out of the box through convention over
    configuration. For clusters with one or more replicas:
    
      - Backup from standby is now enabled by default, unless `target` is
        explicitly set to `primary`
      - Restart of the primary is now the default method to complete the
        unsupervised rolling update procedure (`primaryUpdateMethod`
        defaults to `restart`, unless explicitly set to `switchover`)
    
    For further information, please refer to the
    ["Installation and upgrades" section](../installation_upgrade.md#upgrading-to-120-from-a-previous-minor-version).

Features:

- **Declarative role management:** introduce the `managed.roles` stanza in the
  `Cluster` spec to provide full lifecycle management of database roles, by
  providing an abstraction to the related DDL commands in PostgreSQL, such as
  `CREATE ROLE` and `ALTER ROLE` (#1524, #1793 and #1815)
- **Declarative hibernation of a PostgreSQL cluster:** introduce a new
  annotation called `cnpg.io/hibernation` to declaratively hibernate a
  PostgreSQL cluster by deleting all pods and keeping the PVCs only; the feature
  also implements the inverse procedure (#1657)

Enhancements:

- Improve the `--logs` option of the `report` command of the `cnpg` plugin for
  `kubectl` to also include the previous logs where available (#1811)
- The `-any` service is now disabled by default (#1755)

Security:

- Enable customization of `SeccompProfile` through override via a local file (#1827)

Fixes:

- Apply the PostgreSQL configuration provided by the user during the `initdb`
  bootstrap phase, before the server is started the first time (#1858)
