## Version 1.20.0

**Release date:** April 27, 2023

!!! Important "Important changes from previous versions"
    CloudNativePG 1.20 introduces some changes to the default behavior of a
    few features for newly created `Cluster` resources, compared to previous
    versions of the operator. The goal of these changes is to improve the
    resilience of a Postgres cluster out of the box through convention over
    configuration. For clusters with one or more replicas:
    
      - Backup from standby is now enabled by default, unless `target` is
        explicitly set to `primary`
      - Restart of the primary is now the default method to complete the
        unsupervised rolling update procedure (`primaryUpdateMethod`
        defaults to `restart`, unless explicitly set to `switchover`)
    
    For further information, please refer to the
    ["Installation and upgrades" section](../installation_upgrade.md#upgrading-to-120-from-a-previous-minor-version).

Features:

- **Declarative role management:** introduce the `managed.roles` stanza in the
  `Cluster` spec to provide full lifecycle management of database roles, by
  providing an abstraction to the related DDL commands in PostgreSQL, such as
  `CREATE ROLE` and `ALTER ROLE` (#1524, #1793 and #1815)
- **Declarative hibernation of a PostgreSQL cluster:** introduce a new
  annotation called `cnpg.io/hibernation` to declaratively hibernate a
  PostgreSQL cluster by deleting all pods and keeping the PVCs only; the feature
  also implements the inverse procedure (#1657)

Enhancements:

- Improve the `--logs` option of the `report` command of the `cnpg` plugin for
  `kubectl` to also include the previous logs where available (#1811)
- The `-any` service is now disabled by default (#1755)

Security:

- Enable customization of `SeccompProfile` through override via a local file (#1827)

Fixes:

- Apply the PostgreSQL configuration provided by the user during the `initdb`
  bootstrap phase, before the server is started the first time (#1858)
