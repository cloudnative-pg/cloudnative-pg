# Release notes for CloudNativePG 1.27

History of user-visible changes in the 1.27 minor release of CloudNativePG.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the
[commits](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/commits/release-1.27)
on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.27.1

**Release date:** Oct 23, 2025

### Changes

<!-- NO: 1.25 -->
- Delayed the decommissioning of native in-core support for Barman Cloud to at
  least version 1.29.
  ([#8670](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8670))

- Adopted the new format of `postgres-containers` and `postgis-containers`
  images and image catalog artifacts, and **updated** the default PostgreSQL
  version to `18.0-system-trixie` (PostgreSQL 18 is now supported).
  ([#8578](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8578),
  [#8760](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8760),
  [#8558](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8558))

- Deprecated the `monitoring.enablePodMonitor` field in the `Cluster` and
  `Pooler` resources. This field will be removed in a future release. Users who
  rely on `PodMonitor` resources should create them manually instead.
  ([#8753](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8753))

### Enhancements

- Added support for overriding the PgBouncer `auth_type`, `server_tls_sslmode`,
  and `client_tls_sslmode` settings, which were previously hardcoded. Default
  values remain consistent with the former behavior but can now be customized
  when required.
  ([#8674](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8674))

- Added a `CHECKPOINT` step before PostgreSQL smart and fast shutdowns to
  reduce shutdown duration and replica promotion time, especially on systems
  with a high `checkpoint_timeout`.
  ([#8867](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8867))

- Added a warning in the instance manager for deprecated or unsupported OS
  versions, based on the official `postgres-containers` project.
  ([#8601](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8601))

- Improved certificate parsing error reporting. Failures now log specific
  errors instead of a generic message, aiding troubleshooting. This is
  particularly relevant after the CVE-2025-58187 fix in Go 1.25.2 and 1.24.8,
  which may trigger parsing failures for invalid DNS SANs.
  ([#8801](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8801))

- Added a check to ensure the destination WAL archive path is empty when
  bootstrapping a cluster using the `pg_basebackup` method, consistent with
  other bootstrap methods.
  ([#8895](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8895))

- Added validation to prevent backups from running on hibernated clusters.
  Backups attempted on such clusters now fail with reason
  `ClusterIsHibernated`, following the standard prerequisite check pattern.
  ([#8870](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8870))

- Added support for `pprof` profiling. Instances can now enable the `pprof`
  tool by adding the `alpha.cnpg.io/enableInstancePprof` annotation to the
  `Cluster` resource for advanced debugging.
  ([#7876](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7876))

- `cnpg` plugin:

   - Updated the Flexible I/O Tester (FIO) image to
     `wallnerryan/fiotools-aio:v2`, as provided by Ryan Wallner.
     ([#8847](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8847))

   - Enhanced the `cnpg status backup` command to provide more detailed status
     information when using a `barman-cloud`-based backup plugin.
     ([#8780](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8780),
     [#8690](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8690))

### Fixes

- Fixed backup restoration failures when using custom WAL segment sizes with
  parallel WAL recovery. The operator no longer manages the end-of-WAL file
  marker during restoration, preventing errors when backups span multiple WAL
  segments.
  ([#8873](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8873))

- Fixed a bug in major upgrades where a volume snapshot from a previous minor
  version could be incorrectly used to optimize replica creation.
  ([#8475](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8475))

- Fixed `initdb` to wait for the application user secret before bootstrapping
  a new cluster, preventing potential race conditions.
  ([#8663](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8663))

<!-- NO: 1.25 --><!-- NO: 1.26 -->
- Fixed quorum-based failover to work correctly in clusters with only two
  instances using synchronous replication.
  ([#8680](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8680))

<!-- NO: 1.25 --><!-- NO: 1.26 -->
- Fixed configuration hash calculation to ignore internal configuration fields,
  preventing unnecessary reconciliations.
  ([#8868](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8868))

- Fixed the connection retry logic in the `cnpgi` plugin. The reconciliation
  loop now detects connection pool changes correctly and uses exponential
  backoff to reduce "closed pool" errors.
  ([#8554](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8554))

- Fixed volume snapshot usage during replica scaling to work with backup plugins.
  Previously, this optimization was only available with the in-tree backup
  implementation, but now clusters using backup plugins can also leverage volume
  snapshots when creating new replicas.
  ([#8506](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8506))

- Fixed the `Pooler` templating to correctly inherit settings for the
  bootstrap controller init container.
  ([#8394](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8394))

- Fixed webhook errors to use the correct API group (`postgresql.cnpg.io`) in
  `Pooler` and backup webhooks, ensuring consistent API error reporting.
  ([#8485](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8485))

- Fixed a potential nil pointer dereference in the hibernation reconciler when
  handling errors. Contributed by @PascalBourdier.
  ([#8756](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8756))

- Fixed an issue in the environment cache where callers could inadvertently
  modify shared data. The `LoadEnv` function now returns a copy of cached
  environment slices to prevent mutations from affecting the cache.
  ([#8880](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8880))

## Version 1.27.0

**Release date:** Aug 12, 2025

### Important changes

- The default behavior of the [liveness probe](../instance_manager.md#liveness-probe) has been updated.
  An [isolated primary is now forcibly shut down](../instance_manager.md#primary-isolation)
  within the configured `livenessProbeTimeout` (default: 30 seconds).

### Features

- **Dynamic loading of PostgreSQL extensions**: Introduced the
  `.spec.postgresql.extensions` stanza for mounting PostgreSQL extensions,
  packaged as OCI-compliant container images, as read-only and immutable volumes
  inside instance pods. This allows dynamic extension management without
  rebuilding base images.
  ([#7991](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7991)).

- **Logical decoding slot synchronization in HA clusters**: Added the
  `synchronizeLogicalDecoding` field under
  `spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability` to enable automatic synchronization of
  logical decoding slots across high-availability clusters, ensuring logical
  replication subscribers continue seamlessly after a publisher failover
  ([#7931](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7931)).

- **Primary Isolation Check**: Promoted to stable the liveness pinger
  experimental feature introduced in 1.26, adding the
  `.spec.probes.liveness.isolationCheck` section to enable primary isolation
  checks in the liveness probe by default. This improves the detection and
  handling of primary connectivity issues in Kubernetes environments
  ([#7845](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7845)).

### Enhancements

- Introduced an opt-in experimental feature that enables quorum-based failover
  to improve safety and data durability during failover events. This feature,
  also called failover quorum, can be activated via the
  `alpha.cnpg.io/failoverQuorum` annotation.
  ([#7572](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7572)).

- Added support for user maps for predefined users such as `streaming_replica`,
  allowing the use of self-managed client certificates with different Common
  Names in environments with strict policies or shared CAs, while still enabling
  replicas to join clusters using the `streaming_replica` role
  ([#7725](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7725)).

- Added a new `PhaseFailurePlugin` phase in the `Cluster` status to improve
  observability of plugin-related failures
  ([#7988](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7988)).

- Made the `Backup.spec` field immutable after creation, ensuring consistency
  and predictability in backup operations
  ([#7904](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7904)).

- Added `fqdn-uri` and `fqdn-jdbc-uri` fields in the user secret to simplify
  the retrieval of fully qualified domain name-based connection strings
  ([#7852](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7852)).

- CNPG-I:

    - Added `Postgres` interface support to the CNPG-I operator, continuing the
      transition toward a plugin-based architecture
      ([#7179](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7179)).

    - Added `metrics` capabilities to the CNPG-I instance webserver, enabling
      metrics exposure directly from the instance for better observability
      ([#8033](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8033)).

### Fixes

- Unblocked rollouts when migrating to the `barman-cloud` plugin using the
  `switchover` strategy. Former primary Pods now restart correctly after WAL
  archiving fails due to missing plugin support.
  ([#8236](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8236))

### Supported versions

- Kubernetes 1.33, 1.32, and 1.31
- PostgreSQL 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13
    - PostgreSQL 17.5 is the default image
    - PostgreSQL 13 support ends on November 12, 2025
