<!-- TODO: add to 1.27.1 when the fix is available
## Version 1.27.1

**Release date:** Mon DD, 2025

### Enhancements:

- Enabled simultaneous image and configuration changes, allowing you to update
  the container image (including PostgreSQL version or extensions) and
  PostgreSQL configuration settings in the same operation. The operator first
  applies the image change, followed by the configuration changes in a subsequent
  rollout, ensuring safe and consistent cluster updates
  ([#8115](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8115)).

## Version 1.27.0

**Release date:** Aug 12, 2025

### Important changes:

- The default behavior of the [liveness probe](../instance_manager.md#liveness-probe) has been updated.
  An [isolated primary is now forcibly shut down](../instance_manager.md#primary-isolation)
  within the configured `livenessProbeTimeout` (default: 30 seconds).

### Features:

- **Dynamic loading of PostgreSQL extensions**: Introduced the
  `.spec.postgresql.extensions` stanza for mounting PostgreSQL extensions,
  packaged as OCI-compliant container images, as read-only and immutable volumes
  inside instance pods. This allows dynamic extension management without
  rebuilding base images.
  ([#7991](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7991)).

- **Logical decoding slot synchronization in HA clusters**: Added the
  `synchronizeLogicalDecoding` field under
  `spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability` to enable automatic synchronization of
  logical decoding slots across high-availability clusters, ensuring logical
  replication subscribers continue seamlessly after a publisher failover
  ([#7931](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7931)).

- **Primary Isolation Check**: Promoted to stable the liveness pinger
  experimental feature introduced in 1.26, adding the
  `.spec.probes.liveness.isolationCheck` section to enable primary isolation
  checks in the liveness probe by default. This improves the detection and
  handling of primary connectivity issues in Kubernetes environments
  ([#7845](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7845)).

### Enhancements:

- Introduced an opt-in experimental feature that enables quorum-based failover
  to improve safety and data durability during failover events. This feature,
  also called failover quorum, can be activated via the
  `alpha.cnpg.io/failoverQuorum` annotation.
  ([#7572](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7572)).

- Added support for user maps for predefined users such as `streaming_replica`,
  allowing the use of self-managed client certificates with different Common
  Names in environments with strict policies or shared CAs, while still enabling
  replicas to join clusters using the `streaming_replica` role
  ([#7725](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7725)).

- Added a new `PhaseFailurePlugin` phase in the `Cluster` status to improve
  observability of plugin-related failures
  ([#7988](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7988)).

- Made the `Backup.spec` field immutable after creation, ensuring consistency
  and predictability in backup operations
  ([#7904](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7904)).

- Added `fqdn-uri` and `fqdn-jdbc-uri` fields in the user secret to simplify
  the retrieval of fully qualified domain name-based connection strings
  ([#7852](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7852)).

- CNPG-I:

    - Added `Postgres` interface support to the CNPG-I operator, continuing the
      transition toward a plugin-based architecture
      ([#7179](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7179)).

    - Added `metrics` capabilities to the CNPG-I instance webserver, enabling
      metrics exposure directly from the instance for better observability
      ([#8033](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8033)).

### Fixes

- Unblocked rollouts when migrating to the `barman-cloud` plugin using the
  `switchover` strategy. Former primary Pods now restart correctly after WAL
  archiving fails due to missing plugin support.
  ([#8236](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/8236))

### Supported versions

- Kubernetes 1.33, 1.32, and 1.31
- PostgreSQL 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13
    - PostgreSQL 17.5 is the default image
    - PostgreSQL 13 support ends on November 12, 2025
