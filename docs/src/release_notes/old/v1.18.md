History of user-visible changes in the 1.18 minor release of CloudNativePG.

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the
[commits](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/commits/release-1.18)
on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.18.5

**Release date:** June 12, 2023

:::warning
    This is expected to be the last release in the 1.18.X series. 
    Users are encouraged to update to a newer minor version soon.
:::

Enhancements:

- Add the `snapshot` command to the `cnpg` plugin to create a consistent cold
  backup of the cluster from a standby using the Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot`
  standard resource (#1960)
- First implementation of recovery from a set of CSI VolumeSnapshot resources
  via the `.spec.bootstrap.recovery.volumeSnapshot` stanza (#1960)
- Add `pg_failover_slots` to managed extensions (#2057)
- Improved Grafana dashboard with updated instructions in the documentation and
  the quickstart guide (#1916)
- Introduce the `schemaOnly` option in the `import` stanza, to avoid exporting
  and importing data when you bootstrap a new Postgres Cluster from one or more
  existing databases (#2234)
- Add support for TopologySpreadConstraints to manage scheduling of instance
  pods (#2202)
- Add `PodMonitor` support to the `Pooler`for PgBouncer (#2034)
- Add option to override the default Kubernetes scheduler (#2013)
- Allow configuration of deployment strategy of a `Pooler` resource (#1983)
- Update default PostgreSQL version to 15.3 (#2022)
- Use PgBouncer 1.19 by default (#2018)

Technical enhancements:

- Updated k8s kind tested versions (#2054)
- Use separate transactions to reconcile role credentials. Before this patch,
  the operator would revert the synchronization of all roles if one failed
  (#2004)
- Ensure fencing is removed during cluster restore (#1987)
- Improve logging when deleting Pods (#2136)

Fixes:

- Fix unbound variable with k3s engine which could prevent setup on K3’s (#2157)
- Report the correct PG version in the metrics (#2126)
- Use the correct walStorage key in the documentation (#2140)
- Halt reconciliation when the operator cannot connect with the instances, and
  provide a clear diagnostic on such occasions. This will help clarify cases
  where network issues obstruct normal operation of CloudNativePG (#2145),
  (#2233), and (#2242)

## Version 1.18.4

**Release date:** April 27, 2023

:::info[Important]
    CloudNativePG is dropping support for PostgreSQL 10, as PostgreSQL 10
    reached End-of-Life (EOL) in November 2022. Versions 11 and newer are
    supported. Please plan your migration to PostgreSQL 15 as soon as possible.
    Refer to ["Importing Postgres databases"](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/database_import/)
    for more information on PostgreSQL major offline upgrades.
:::

Enhancements:

- Improve the `--logs` option of the `report` command of the `cnpg` plugin for
  `kubectl` to also include the previous logs where available (#1811)
- The `-any` service is now disabled by default (#1755)

Security:

- Enable customization of `SeccompProfile` through override via a local file (#1827)

  the user to start a `psql` session with a pod (the primary by default)

Technical enhancements:

- Adopt Renovate for dependency tracking/updating (#1367, #1473)
- Inject binaries for all supported architectures in the operator image (#1513)
- Use the backup name to match resources in the backup object store (#1650)
  Leverages the `--name` option introduced with Barman 3.3 to make the

- Enhance WAL observability with additional metrics for the Prometheus
  exporter, including values equivalent to the `min_wal_size`, `max_wal_size`,
  `keep_wal_size`, `wal_keep_segments`, as well as the maximum number of WALs
  that can be stored in the dedicated volume (#1382)
- Add a database comment on the `streaming_replica` user (#1349)
- Document the firewall issues with webhooks on GKE (#1364)

- Avoid looking for `PodMonitor` when not needed (#1213)

## Version 1.18.1

**Release date:** Dec 21, 2022

Important announcements:

- Alert on the impending deprecation of `postgresql` as a label to identify the
  CNPG cluster. In the remote case you have used this label, please start using
  the `cnpg.io/cluster` label instead (#1130)
- Recognizing Armando Ruocco (@armru) as a new CloudNativePG maintainer for his
  consistent and impactful contributions (#1167)
- Remove ARMv7 support (#1092)
- FINAL patch release for 1.16: 1.16.5. Release 1.16 reaches end of life.

Enhancements:

- Customize labels and annotations for the service account: add a service
  account template that can be used, for example, to make authentication easier
  via identity management on GKE or EKS via IRSA (#1105)
- Add `nodeAffinity` support (#1182) - allows for richer scheduling options
- Improve compatibility with Istio: add support for Istio's quit endpoint so

  - Remove references to CNPG sandbox (#1120) - the CNPG sandbox has been
    deprecated, in favor of instructions on monitoring in the Quickstart
    documentation
  - Link to the "Release updates" discussion (#1148) - the release updates
    discussion will become the default channel for release announcements and
    discussions

    how maintainers should proceed if they are not ready to continue
    contributing
  - Improve instructions on creating pull requests (#1132)
  - Troubleshooting emergency backup instructions (#1184)
- Cover the Kubernetes layer in greater detail in the Architecture
  documentation (#1432)

Fixes:

- Respect configured pg-wal when restoring (#1216)
- Filter out replicas from nodeToClusters map (#1194)

Technical enhancements:

- Use `ciclops` for test summary (#1064): rely on the ciclops GitHub action to
  provide summaries of the E2E suite, inheriting improvements from that project
- Add backport pull request workflow (#965) - automatically backport patches to
  release branches if they are so annotated
- Make the operator log level configurable in e2e test suite (#1094)
- Enable test execution based on labels (#951)

## Version 1.18.0

**Release date:** Nov 10, 2022

Features:

- **Cluster-managed physical replication slots for High Availability**:
  automatically manages physical replication slots for each hot standby replica
  in the High Availability cluster, both in the primary and the standby (#740)
- **Postgres cluster hibernation**: introduces cluster hibernation via the plugin,
  with a new subcommand `kubectl cnpg hibernate on/off/status <cluster-name>`.
  Hibernation destroys all the resources generated by the cluster, except the
  PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary instance (#782)

Security:

- Add `SeccomProfile` to Pods and Containers (#888)

Enhancements:

- Allow omitting the storage size in the cluster spec if there is a size request
  in the `pvcTemplate` (#914)
- `status` command for the `cnpg` plugin:
  - Add replication slots information (#873)
  - Clarify display for fenced clusters (#886)
  - Improve display for replica clusters (#871)
- Documentation:
  - Improve monitoring page, providing instructions on how to evaluate the
    observability capabilities of CloudNativePG on a local system using
    Prometheus and Grafana (#968)
  - Add page on design reasons for custom controller (#918)
  - Updates to the End-to-End Test Suite page (#945)
- New subcommands in the `cnpg` plugin:
    - `pgbench` generates a job definition executing `pgbench` against a cluster
    (#958)
    - `install` generates an installation manifest for the operator (#944)
- Set PostgreSQL 15.0 as the new default version (#821)

Fixes:

- Import a database with `plpgsql` functions (#974)
- Properly find the closest backup when doing Point-in-time recovery (#949)
- Clarify that the `ScheduledBackup` format does not follow Kubernetes `CronJob`
  format (#883)
- Bases the failover logic on the Postgres information from the instance
  manager, rather than Kubernetes pod readiness, which could be stale (#890)
- Ensure we have a WAL to archive for every newly created cluster. The lack
  could prevent backups from working (#897)
- Correct YAML key names for `barmanObjectStore` in documentation (#877)
- Fix `krew` release (#866)
