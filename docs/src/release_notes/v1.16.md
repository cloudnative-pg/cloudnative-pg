##  Version 1.16.0

**Release date:** Jul 7, 2022 (minor release)

Features:

- **Offline data import and major upgrades for PostgreSQL:** introduce the
  `bootstrap.initdb.import` section to provide a way to import objects via the
  network from an existing PostgreSQL instance (even outside Kubernetes) inside a
  brand new CloudNativePG cluster using the PostgreSQL logical backup concept
  (`pg_dump`/`pg_restore`). The same method can be used to perform major
  PostgreSQL upgrades on a new cluster. The feature introduces two types of
  import: `microservice` (import one database only in the new cluster) and
  `monolith` (import the selected databases and roles from the existing
  instance).
- Anti-affinity rules for synchronous replication based on labels: make sure
  that synchronous replicas are running on nodes with different characteristics
  than the node where the primary is running, for example, availability zone

Enhancements:

- Improve fencing by removing the existing limitation that disables failover
  when one or more instances are fenced
- Enhance the automated extension management framework by checking whether an
  extension exists in the catalog instead of  running `DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS`
  unnecessarily
- Improve logging of the instance manager during switchover and failover
- Enable redefining the name of the database of the application, its owner, and
  the related secret when recovering from an object store or cloning an
  instance via `pg_basebackup` (this was only possible in the `initdb` bootstrap
  so far)
- Backup and recovery:
    - Require Barman >= 3.0.0 for future support of PostgreSQL 15
    - Enable Azure AD Workload Identity for Barman Cloud backups through the
      `inheritFromAzureAD` option
    - Introduce `barmanObjectStore.s3Credentials.region` to define the region
      in AWS (`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`) for both backup and recovery object stores
- Support for Kubernetes 1.24

Changes:

- Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 14.4
- Use conditions from the Kubernetes API instead of relying on our own
  implementation for backup and WAL archiving

Fixes:

- Fix the initialization order inside the `WithActiveInstance` function that
  starts the CSV log pipe for the PostgreSQL server, ensuring proper logging in
  the cluster initialization phase - this is especially useful in bootstrap
  operations like recovery from a backup are failing (before this patch, such
  logs were not sent to the standard output channel and were permanently lost)
- Avoid an unnecessary switchover when a hot standby sensitive parameter is
  decreased, and the primary has already restarted
- Properly quote role names in `ALTER ROLE` statements
- Backup and recovery:
    - Fix the algorithm detecting the closest Barman backup for PITR, which was
      comparing the requested recovery timestamp with the backup start instead
      of the end
    - Fix Point in Time Recovery based on a transaction ID, a named restore
      point, or the “immediate” target by providing a new field called
      `backupID` in the `recoveryTarget` section
    - Fix encryption parameters invoking `barman-cloud-wal-archive` and
      `barman-cloud-backup` commands
    - Stop ignoring `barmanObjectStore.serverName` option when recovering from
      a backup object store using a server name that doesn’t match the current
      cluster name
- `cnpg` plug-in:
    - Make sure that the plug-in complies with the `-n` parameter when
      specified by the user
    - Fix the `status` command to sort results and remove variability in the
      output
