## Version 1.18.0

**Release date:** Nov 10, 2022

Features:

- **Cluster-managed physical replication slots for High Availability**:
  automatically manages physical replication slots for each hot standby replica
  in the High Availability cluster, both in the primary and the standby (#740)
- **Postgres cluster hibernation**: introduces cluster hibernation via the plugin,
  with a new subcommand `kubectl cnpg hibernate on/off/status <cluster-name>`.
  Hibernation destroys all the resources generated by the cluster, except the
  PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary instance (#782)

Security:

- Add `SeccomProfile` to Pods and Containers (#888)

Enhancements:

- Allow omitting the storage size in the cluster spec if there is a size request
  in the `pvcTemplate` (#914)
- `status` command for the `cnpg` plugin:
  - Add replication slots information (#873)
  - Clarify display for fenced clusters (#886)
  - Improve display for replica clusters (#871)
- Documentation:
  - Improve monitoring page, providing instructions on how to evaluate the
    observability capabilities of CloudNativePG on a local system using
    Prometheus and Grafana (#968)
  - Add page on design reasons for custom controller (#918)
  - Updates to the End-to-End Test Suite page (#945)
- New subcommands in the `cnpg` plugin:
    - `pgbench` generates a job definition executing `pgbench` against a cluster
    (#958)
    - `install` generates an installation manifest for the operator (#944)
- Set PostgreSQL 15.0 as the new default version (#821)

Fixes:

- Import a database with `plpgsql` functions (#974)
- Properly find the closest backup when doing Point-in-time recovery (#949)
- Clarify that the `ScheduledBackup` format does not follow Kubernetes `CronJob`
  format (#883)
- Bases the failover logic on the Postgres information from the instance
  manager, rather than Kubernetes pod readiness, which could be stale (#890)
- Ensure we have a WAL to archive for every newly created cluster. The lack
  could prevent backups from working (#897)
- Correct YAML key names for `barmanObjectStore` in documentation (#877)
- Fix `krew` release (#866)
