  bootstrap phase, before the server is started the first time (#1858)

## Version 1.18.1

**Release date:** Dec 21, 2022

Important announcements:

- Alert on the impending deprecation of `postgresql` as a label to identify the
  CNPG cluster. In the remote case you have used this label, please start using
  the `cnpg.io/cluster` label instead (#1130)
- Recognizing Armando Ruocco (@armru) as a new CloudNativePG maintainer for his
  consistent and impactful contributions (#1167)
- Remove ARMv7 support (#1092)
- FINAL patch release for 1.16: 1.16.5. Release 1.16 reaches end of life.

Enhancements:

- Customize labels and annotations for the service account: add a service
  account template that can be used, for example, to make authentication easier
  via identity management on GKE or EKS via IRSA (#1105)
- Add `nodeAffinity` support (#1182) - allows for richer scheduling options
- Improve compatibility with Istio: add support for Istio's quit endpoint so
  that jobs with Istio sidecars do not run indefinitely (#967)
- Allow fields remapping in JSON logs: helpful for use cases where the `level`
  and `ts` fields might interfere with the  existing logging (#843)
- Add `fio` command to the kubectl-cnpg plugin (#1097)
- Add rpm/deb package for kubectl-cnpg plugin (#1008)
- Update default PostgreSQL version for new cluster definitions to 15.1 (#908)
- Documentation
  - Remove references to CNPG sandbox (#1120) - the CNPG sandbox has been
    deprecated, in favor of instructions on monitoring in the Quickstart
    documentation
  - Link to the "Release updates" discussion (#1148) - the release updates
    discussion will become the default channel for release announcements and
    discussions
  - Document emeritus status for maintainers in GOVERNANCE.md (#1033) - explains
    how maintainers should proceed if they are not ready to continue
    contributing
  - Improve instructions on creating pull requests (#1132)
  - Troubleshooting emergency backup instructions (#1184)
- Cover the Kubernetes layer in greater detail in the Architecture
  documentation (#1432)

Fixes:

- Ensure PGDATA permissions on bootstrap are properly set to 750 (#1164)

(#1088)
- Ensure that we create secrets and services only when not found (#1145)
- Respect configured pg-wal when restoring (#1216)
- Filter out replicas from nodeToClusters map (#1194)

Technical enhancements:

- Use `ciclops` for test summary (#1064): rely on the ciclops GitHub action to
  provide summaries of the E2E suite, inheriting improvements from that project
- Add backport pull request workflow (#965) - automatically backport patches to
  release branches if they are so annotated
- Make the operator log level configurable in e2e test suite (#1094)
- Enable test execution based on labels (#951)
- Update Go version from 1.18 to 1.19 (#1166)

## Version 1.18.0

**Release date:** Nov 10, 2022

Features:

- **Cluster-managed physical replication slots for High Availability**:
  automatically manages physical replication slots for each hot standby replica
  in the High Availability cluster, both in the primary and the standby (#740)
- **Postgres cluster hibernation**: introduces cluster hibernation via the plugin,
  with a new subcommand `kubectl cnpg hibernate on/off/status <cluster-name>`.
  Hibernation destroys all the resources generated by the cluster, except the
  PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary instance (#782)

Security:

- Add `SeccomProfile` to Pods and Containers (#888)

Enhancements:

- Allow omitting the storage size in the cluster spec if there is a size request
  in the `pvcTemplate` (#914)
- `status` command for the `cnpg` plugin:
  - Add replication slots information (#873)
  - Clarify display for fenced clusters (#886)
  - Improve display for replica clusters (#871)
- Documentation:
  - Improve monitoring page, providing instructions on how to evaluate the
    observability capabilities of CloudNativePG on a local system using
    Prometheus and Grafana (#968)
  - Add page on design reasons for custom controller (#918)
  - Updates to the End-to-End Test Suite page (#945)
- New subcommands in the `cnpg` plugin:
    - `pgbench` generates a job definition executing `pgbench` against a cluster
    (#958)
    - `install` generates an installation manifest for the operator (#944)
- Set PostgreSQL 15.0 as the new default version (#821)

Fixes:

- Import a database with `plpgsql` functions (#974)
- Properly find the closest backup when doing Point-in-time recovery (#949)
- Clarify that the `ScheduledBackup` format does not follow Kubernetes `CronJob`
  format (#883)
- Bases the failover logic on the Postgres information from the instance
  manager, rather than Kubernetes pod readiness, which could be stale (#890)
- Ensure we have a WAL to archive for every newly created cluster. The lack
  could prevent backups from working (#897)
- Correct YAML key names for `barmanObjectStore` in documentation (#877)
- Fix `krew` release (#866)
