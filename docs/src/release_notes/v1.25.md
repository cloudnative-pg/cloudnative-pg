## Version 1.25.0

**Release Date:** December 23, 2024

### Features

- **Declarative Database Management**: Introduce the `Database` Custom Resource
  Definition (CRD), enabling users to create and manage PostgreSQL databases
  declaratively within a cluster. (#5325)

- **Logical Replication Management**: Add `Publication` and `Subscription` CRDs
  for declarative management of PostgreSQL logical replication. These simplify
  replication setup and facilitate online migrations to CloudNativePG. (#5329)

### Enhancements

- Add the `dataDurability` option to the `.spec.postgresql.synchronous` stanza,
  allowing users to choose between `required` (default) or `preferred`
  durability in synchronous replication. (#5878)
- Enable customization of startup, liveness, and readiness probes through the
  `.spec.probes` stanza. (#6266)
- Support additional `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` options to enhance database
  import flexibility. (#6214)
- Add support for `maxConcurrentReconciles` in the CloudNativePG controller and
  set the default to 10, improving the operator's ability to efficiently manage
  larger deployments out of the box. (#5678)
- Add the `cnpg.io/userType` label to secrets generated for predefined users,
  specifically `superuser` and `app`. (#4392)
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Enhance the `backup` command to support plugins. (#6045)
    - Honor the `User-Agent` header in HTTP requests with the API server. (#6153)

### Bug Fixes

- Ensure the former primary flushes its WAL file queue to the archive before
  re-synchronizing as a replica, reducing recovery times and enhancing data
  consistency during failovers. (#6141)
- Clean the WAL volume along with the `PGDATA` volume during bootstrap. (#6265)
- Update the operator to set the cluster phase to `Unrecoverable` when
  all previously generated `PersistentVolumeClaims` are missing. (#6170)
- Fix the parsing of the `synchronous_standby_names` GUC when
  `.spec.postgresql.synchronous.method` is set to `first`. (#5955)
- Correct role changes to apply at the transaction level instead of the
  database context. (#6064)
- Remove the `primary_slot_name` definition from the `override.conf` file on
  the primary to ensure it is always empty. (#6219)
- Configure libpq environment variables, including `PGHOST`, in PgBouncer pods
  to enable seamless access to the `pgbouncer` virtual database using `psql`
  from within the container. (#6247)
- Remove unnecessary updates to the Cluster status when verifying changes in
  the image catalog. (#6277)
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Ensure the `kubectl` context is properly passed in the `psql` command. (#6257)
    - Avoid displaying physical backups block when empty with `status` command. (#5998)
