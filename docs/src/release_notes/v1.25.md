## Version 1.25.1

**Release Date:** February 28, 2025

### Enhancements

- Introduced a startup probe for the operator to enhance reliability and
  prevent premature liveness probe failures during initialization. (#7008)
- Added support for using the `-r` service with the Pooler. (#6868)
- Introduced an optional `--ttl` flag for the `pgbench` plugin, enabling
  automatic deletion of completed jobs after a user-defined duration. (#6701)
- Marked known error messages from the Azure CSI Driver for volume snapshots as
  retryable, improving resilience. (#6906)
- Updated the default PostgreSQL version to 17.4 for new cluster
  definitions. (#6960)

### Security

- The operator image build process has been enhanced to strengthen
  security and transparency. Images are now signed with `cosign`, and
  OCI attestations are generated, incorporating the Software Bill of
  Materials (SBOM) and provenance data. Additionally, OCI annotations
  have been added to improve traceability and ensure the integrity of
  the images.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed inconsistent behavior in default probe knob values when `.spec.probes`
  is defined, ensuring users can override all settings, including
  `failureThreshold`. If unspecified in the startup probe, `failureThreshold` is
  now correctly derived from `.spec.startupDelay / periodSeconds` (default: `10`,
  now overridable). The same logic applies to liveness probes via
  `.spec.livenessProbeTimeout`. (#6656)
- Managed service ports now take precedence over default operator-defined
  ports. (#6474)
- Fixed an issue where WAL metrics were unavailable after an instance restart
  until a configuration change was applied. (#6816)
- Fixed an issue in monolithic database import where role import was skipped if
  no roles were specified. (#6646)
- Added support for new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.24. (#6630)
- Resolved an issue where `Database`, `Publication`, and `Subscription` CRDs
  became stuck in `cluster resource has been deleted, skipping reconciliation`
  after cluster rehydration. This patch forces `status.observedGeneration` to
  zero, ensuring proper reconciliation. (#6607) <!-- 1.25 only -->
- Improved handling of replication-sensitive parameter reductions by ensuring
  timely reconciliation after primary server restarts. (#6440)
- Introduced a new `isWALArchiver` flag in the CNPG-I plugin configuration,
  allowing users to designate a plugin as a WAL archiver. This enables seamless
  migration from in-tree Barman Cloud support to the plugin while maintaining WAL
  archive consistency. (#6593)
- Ensured `override.conf` is consistently included in `postgresql.conf` during
  replica cluster bootstrapping, preventing replication failures due to missing
  configuration settings. (#6808)
- Ensured `override.conf` is correctly initialized before invoking `pg_rewind`
  to prevent failures during primary role changes. (#6670)
- Enhanced webhook responses to return both warnings and errors when
  applicable, improving diagnostic accuracy. (#6579)
- Ensured the operator version is correctly reconciled. (#6496)
- Improved PostgreSQL version detection by using a more precise check of the
  data directory. (#6659)
- Volume Snapshot Backups:
    - Fixed an issue where unused backup connections were not properly cleaned
      up. (#6882)
    - Ensured the instance manager closes stale PostgreSQL connections left by
      failed volume snapshot backups. (#6879)
    - Prevented the operator from starting a new volume snapshot backup while
      another is already in progress. (#6890)
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Restored functionality of the `promote` plugin command. (#6476)
    - Enhanced `kubectl cnpg report --logs <cluster>` to collect logs from all
      containers, including sidecars. (#6636)
    - Ensured `pgbench` jobs can run when a `Cluster` uses an `ImageCatalog`.
      (#6868)

### Technical Enhancements

- Added support for Kubernetes `client-gen`, enabling automated generation of
  Go clients for all CloudNativePG CRDs. (#6695)

## Version 1.25.0

**Release Date:** December 23, 2024

### Features

- **Declarative Database Management**: Introduce the `Database` Custom Resource
  Definition (CRD), enabling users to create and manage PostgreSQL databases
  declaratively within a cluster. (#5325)

- **Logical Replication Management**: Add `Publication` and `Subscription` CRDs
  for declarative management of PostgreSQL logical replication. These simplify
  replication setup and facilitate online migrations to CloudNativePG. (#5329)

- **Experimental Support for CNPG-I**: Introducing CNPG-I (CloudNativePG
  Interface), a standardized framework designed to extend CloudNativePG
  functionality through third-party plugins and foster the growth of the CNPG
  ecosystem.
  The [Barman Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud) serves as a live
  example, illustrating how plugins can be developed to enhance backup and
  recovery workflows. Although CNPG-I support is currently experimental, it
  offers a powerful approach to extending CloudNativePG without modifying the
  operator’s core code—akin to PostgreSQL extensions. We welcome community
  feedback and contributions to shape this exciting new capability.

### Enhancements

- Add the `dataDurability` option to the `.spec.postgresql.synchronous` stanza,
  allowing users to choose between `required` (default) or `preferred`
  durability in synchronous replication. (#5878)
- Enable customization of startup, liveness, and readiness probes through the
  `.spec.probes` stanza. (#6266)
- Support additional `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` options to enhance database
  import flexibility. (#6214)
- Add support for `maxConcurrentReconciles` in the CloudNativePG controller and
  set the default to 10, improving the operator's ability to efficiently manage
  larger deployments out of the box. (#5678)
- Add the `cnpg.io/userType` label to secrets generated for predefined users,
  specifically `superuser` and `app`. (#4392)
- Improved validation for the `spec.schedule` field in ScheduledBackups,
  raising warnings for potential misconfigurations. (#5396)
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Enhance the `backup` command to support plugins. (#6045)
    - Honor the `User-Agent` header in HTTP requests with the API server. (#6153)

### Bug Fixes

- Ensure the former primary flushes its WAL file queue to the archive before
  re-synchronizing as a replica, reducing recovery times and enhancing data
  consistency during failovers. (#6141)
- Clean the WAL volume along with the `PGDATA` volume during bootstrap. (#6265)
- Update the operator to set the cluster phase to `Unrecoverable` when
  all previously generated `PersistentVolumeClaims` are missing. (#6170)
- Fix the parsing of the `synchronous_standby_names` GUC when
  `.spec.postgresql.synchronous.method` is set to `first`. (#5955)
- Resolved a potential race condition when patching certain conditions
  in CRD statuses, improving reliability in concurrent updates. (#6328)
- Correct role changes to apply at the transaction level instead of the
  database context. (#6064)
- Remove the `primary_slot_name` definition from the `override.conf` file on
  the primary to ensure it is always empty. (#6219)
- Configure libpq environment variables, including `PGHOST`, in PgBouncer pods
  to enable seamless access to the `pgbouncer` virtual database using `psql`
  from within the container. (#6247)
- Remove unnecessary updates to the Cluster status when verifying changes in
  the image catalog. (#6277)
- Prevent panic during recovery from an external server without proper backup
  configuration. (#6300)
- Resolved a key collision issue in structured logs, where the name field was
  inconsistently used to log two distinct values. (#6324)
- Ensure proper quoting of the inRoles field in SQL statements to prevent
  syntax errors in generated SQL during role management. (#6346)
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Ensure the `kubectl` context is properly passed in the `psql` command. (#6257)
    - Avoid displaying physical backups block when empty with `status` command. (#5998)
