on the release branch in GitHub.

## Version 1.17.2

**Release date:** Nov 10, 2022

Security:

- Add `SeccomProfile` to Pods and Containers (#888)

Enhancements:

- `status` command for the `cnpg` plugin:
  - Clarify display for fenced clusters (#886)
  - Improve display for replica clusters (#871)
- Documentation:
  - Improve monitoring page, providing instructions on how to evaluate the
    observability capabilities of CloudNativePG on a local system using
    Prometheus and Grafana (#968)
  - Add page on design reasons for custom controller (#918)
- Set PostgreSQL 15.0 as the new default version (#821)

Fixes:

- Import a database with `plpgsql` functions (#974)
- Properly find the closest backup when doing Point-in-time recovery (#949)
- Clarify that the `ScheduledBackup` format does not follow Kubernetes `CronJob`
  format (#883)
- Bases the failover logic on the Postgres information from the instance
  manager, rather than Kubernetes pod readiness, which could be stale (#890)
- Ensure we have a WAL to archive for every newly created cluster. The lack
  could prevent backups from working (#897)
- Correct YAML key names for `barmanObjectStore` in documentation (#877)
- Fix `krew` release (#866)

##  Version 1.17.1

**Release date:** Oct 6, 2022

Enhancements:

-  Introduce `leaseDuration` and `renewDeadline` parameters in the controller
   manager to enhance configuration of the leader election in operator
   deployments (#759)
-  Improve the mechanism that checks that the backup object store is empty
   before archiving a WAL file for the first time: a new file called
   `.check-empty-wal-archive` is placed in the `PGDATA` immediately after
   the cluster is bootstrapped and it is then removed after the first WAL
   file is successfully archived

Security:

- Explicitly set permissions of the instance manager binary that is copied in
  the `distroless/static:nonroot` container image, by using the
  `nonroot:nonroot` user (#754)

Fixes:

- Drop any active connection on a standby after it is promoted to primary (#737)
- Honor `MAPPEDMETRIC` and `DURATION` metric types conversion in the native
  Prometheus exporter  (#765)
- Ensure that timestamps that are specified with microsecond precision using the
  PostgreSQL format are correctly parsed (#741)

##  Version 1.17.0

**Release date:** Sep 6, 2022 (minor release)

Features:

- **Separate volume for WAL files:** Support for separating Write Ahead Log
  (WAL) and database data files onto different disks, potentially leading to
  better performance on high write systems by easing I/O load on the data
  directory. This option is controlled with the introduction of the optional
  `walStorage`	section to separate WAL files (`pg_wal`) in a dedicated volume,
  separate from the `PGDATA` defined in the main and mandatory `storage` section
  (#513). Current limitations: `walStorage` can only be set at cluster creation
  and cannot be added or removed when the cluster is up and running.

Enhancements:

- Enable configuration of low-level network TCP settings in the PgBouncer
  connection pooler implementation (#584)
- Make sure that the `cnpg.io/instanceName` and the `cnpg.io/podRole` labels
  are always present on pods and PVCs (#632 and #680)
- Propagate the `role` label of an instance to the underlying PVC (#634)
- Introduce the `kubectl cnpg destroy` command to help remove an instance and
  all the associated PVCs (#643)

Fixes:

- Use `shared_preload_libraries` when bootstrapping the new cluster's primary
  (#642)
- Prevent multiple in-place upgrade processes of the operator from running
  simultaneously by atomically checking whether another one is in progress (#655)
- Avoid using a hardcoded file name to store the newly uploaded instance
  manager, preventing a possible race condition during online upgrades of the
  operator (#660)
- Prevent a panic from happening when invoking `GetAllAccessibleDatabases`
  (#641)
