##  Version 1.17.0

**Release date:** Sep 6, 2022 (minor release)

Features:

- **Separate volume for WAL files:** Support for separating Write Ahead Log
  (WAL) and database data files onto different disks, potentially leading to
  better performance on high write systems by easing I/O load on the data
  directory. This option is controlled with the introduction of the optional
  `walStorage`	section to separate WAL files (`pg_wal`) in a dedicated volume,
  separate from the `PGDATA` defined in the main and mandatory `storage` section
  (#513). Current limitations: `walStorage` can only be set at cluster creation
  and cannot be added or removed when the cluster is up and running.

Enhancements:

- Enable configuration of low-level network TCP settings in the PgBouncer
  connection pooler implementation (#584)
- Make sure that the `cnpg.io/instanceName` and the `cnpg.io/podRole` labels
  are always present on pods and PVCs (#632 and #680)
- Propagate the `role` label of an instance to the underlying PVC (#634)
- Introduce the `kubectl cnpg destroy` command to help remove an instance and
  all the associated PVCs (#643)

Fixes:

- Use `shared_preload_libraries` when bootstrapping the new cluster's primary
  (#642)
- Prevent multiple in-place upgrade processes of the operator from running
  simultaneously by atomically checking whether another one is in progress (#655)
- Avoid using a hardcoded file name to store the newly uploaded instance
  manager, preventing a possible race condition during online upgrades of the
  operator (#660)
- Prevent a panic from happening when invoking `GetAllAccessibleDatabases`
  (#641)
