# Operator configuration

The operator for Cloud Native PostgreSQL is installed from a standard
deployment manifest and follows the convention over configuration paradigm.
While this is fine in most cases, there are some scenarios where you want
to change the default behavior, such as:

- defining annotations and labels to be inherited by all resources created
  by the operator and that are set in the cluster resource
- defining a different default image for PostgreSQL or an additional pull secret

By default, the operator is installed in the `postgresql-operator-system`
namespace as a Kubernetes `Deployment` called `postgresql-operator-controller-manager`.

!!! Note
    In the examples below we assume the default name and namespace for the operator deployment.

The behavior of the operator can be customized through a `ConfigMap`/`Secret` that
is located in the same namespace of the operator deployment and with
`postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config` as the name.

!!! Important
    Any change to the config's `ConfigMap`/`Secret` will not be automatically
    detected by the operator, - and as such, it needs to be reloaded (see below).
    Moreover, changes only apply to the resources created after the configuration
    is reloaded.

!!! Important
    The operator first processes the ConfigMap values and then the Secretâ€™s, in this order.
    As a result, if a parameter is defined in both places, the one in the Secret will be used.

## Available options

The operator looks for the following environment variables to be defined in the `ConfigMap`/`Secret`:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
`INHERITED_ANNOTATIONS` | list of annotation names that, when defined in a `Cluster` metadata, will be inherited by all the generated resources, including pods
`INHERITED_LABELS` | list of label names that, when defined in a `Cluster` metadata, will be inherited by all the generated resources, including pods
`PULL_SECRET_NAME` | name of an additional pull secret to be defined in the operator's namespace and to be used to download images
`ENABLE_INSTANCE_MANAGER_INPLACE_UPDATES` | when set to `true`, enables in-place updates of the instance manager after an update of the operator, avoiding rolling updates of the cluster (default `false`) |
`MONITORING_QUERIES_CONFIGMAP` | The name of a ConfigMap in the operator's namespace with a set of default queries (to be specified under the key `queries`) to be applied to all created Clusters|

Values in `INHERITED_ANNOTATIONS` and `INHERITED_LABELS` support path-like wildcards. For example, the value `example.com/*` will match
both the value `example.com/one` and `example.com/two`.

## Defining an operator config map

The example below customizes the behavior of the operator, by defining
the label/annotation names to be inherited by the resources created by
any `Cluster` object that is deployed at a later time, and by enabling
[in-place updates for the instance
manager](installation_upgrade.md#in-place-updates-of-the-instance-manager).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config
  namespace: postgresql-operator-system
data:
  INHERITED_ANNOTATIONS: categories
  INHERITED_LABELS: environment, workload, app
  ENABLE_INSTANCE_MANAGER_INPLACE_UPDATES: 'true'
```

## Defining an operator secret

The example below customizes the behavior of the operator, by defining
the label/annotation names to be inherited by the resources created by
any `Cluster` object that is deployed at a later time, and by enabling
[in-place updates for the instance
manager](installation_upgrade.md#in-place-updates-of-the-instance-manager).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config
  namespace: postgresql-operator-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  INHERITED_ANNOTATIONS: categories
  INHERITED_LABELS: environment, workload, app
  ENABLE_INSTANCE_MANAGER_INPLACE_UPDATES: 'true'
```

## Restarting the operator to reload configs

For the change to be effective, you need to recreate the operator pods to
reload the config map. If you have installed the operator on Kubernetes
using the manifest you can do that by issuing:

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deployment \
    -n postgresql-operator-system \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```

Otherwise, If you have installed the operator using OLM, or you are running on
Openshift, run the following command specifying the namespace the operator is
installed in:

```shell
kubectl delete pods -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-native-postgresql
```

!!! Warning
    Customizations will be applied only to `Cluster` resources created
    after the reload of the operator deployment.

Following the above example, if the `Cluster` definition contains a `categories`
annotation and any of the `environment`, `workload`, or `app` labels, these will
be inherited by all the resources generated by the deployment.
