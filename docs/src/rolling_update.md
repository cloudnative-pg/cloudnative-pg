# Rolling Updates

The operator allows changing the PostgreSQL version used in a cluster while
applications are running against it.

!!! Important
    Only upgrades for PostgreSQL minor releases are supported.

Rolling upgrades are started when:

- the user changes the `imageName` attribute of the cluster specification;

- a change in the PostgreSQL configuration requires a restart to be
  applied;

- a change on the `Cluster` `.spec.resources` values

- a change in size of the persistent volume claim on AKS

- after the operator is updated, to ensure the Pods run the latest instance
  manager (unless [in-place updates are enabled](installation_upgrade.md#in-place-updates-of-the-instance-manager)).

The operator starts upgrading all the replicas, one Pod at a time, and begins
from the one with the highest serial.

The primary is the last node to be upgraded.

Rolling updates are configurable and can be either entirely automated
(`unsupervised`) or requiring human intervention (`supervised`).

The upgrade keeps the Cloud Native PostgreSQL identity, without re-cloning the
data. Pods will be deleted and created again with the same PVCs and a new
image, if required.

During the rolling update procedure, each service endpoints move to reflect the
cluster's status, so that applications can ignore the node that is being
updated.

## Automated updates (`unsupervised`)

When `primaryUpdateStrategy` is set to `unsupervised`, the rolling update
process is managed by Kubernetes and is entirely automated. Once the replicas
have been upgraded, the selected `primaryUpdateMethod` operation will initiate
on the primary. This is the default behavior.

The `primaryUpdateMethod` option accepts one of the following values:

- `switchover`: a switchover operation is automatically performed, setting the
  most aligned replica as the new target primary, and shutting down the former
  primary pod (default).

- `restart`: if possible, perform an automated restart of the pod where the
  primary instance is running. Otherwise, the restart request is ignored and a
  switchover issued.

!!! IMPORTANT
    A current limitation is that `restart` is only possible with rolling
    updates that involve configuration changes.

## Manual updates (`supervised`)

When `primaryUpdateStrategy` is set to `supervised`, the rolling update process
is suspended immediately after all replicas have been upgraded.

This phase can only be completed with either a manual switchover or an in-place
restart.

You can trigger a switchover with:

```bash
kubectl cnp promote [cluster] [new_primary]
```

You can trigger a restart with:

```bash
kubectl cnp restart [cluster] [current_primary]
```

You can find more information in the [`cnp` plugin page](cnp-plugin.md).
