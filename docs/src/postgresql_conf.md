# PostgreSQL Configuration

Users that are familiar with PostgreSQL are aware of the existence of the following two files
to configure an instance:

- `postgresql.conf`: main run time configuration file of PostgreSQL
- `pg_hba.conf`: clients authentication file

Due to the concepts of declarative configuration and immutability of the PostgreSQL
containers, users are not allowed to directly touch those files. Configuration
is possible through the `postgresql` section of the `Cluster` resource definition
by defining custom `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` settings via the
`parameters` and the `pg_hba` keys.
A reference for custom settings usage is included in the samples, see
[`cluster-example-custom.yaml`](samples/cluster-example-custom.yaml).

These settings are the same across all instances.

!!! Warning
    **OpenShift users:** due to a current limitation of the OpenShift user interface,
    it is possible to change PostgreSQL settings from the YAML pane only.

## The `postgresql` section

The PostgreSQL instance in the pod starts with a default `postgresql.conf` file,
to which these settings are automatically added:

```text
listen_addresses = '*'
include custom.conf
```

The `custom.conf` file will contain the user-defined settings. Refer to the
PostgreSQL documentation for [more information on the available parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html).
The content of `custom.conf` is automatically generated and maintained by the
operator by applying the following sections in this order:

- Global default parameters
- Default parameters that depend on the PostgreSQL major version
- User provided parameters
- Fixed parameters

The **global default parameters** are:

```text
logging_collector = 'off'
max_parallel_workers = '32'
max_replication_slots = '32'
max_worker_processes = '32'
```

The **default parameters for PostgreSQL 13 or higher** are:

```text
wal_keep_size = '512MB'
```

The **default parameters for PostgreSQL 10 to 12** are:

```text
wal_keep_segments = '32'
```

The following parameters are **fixed** and exclusively controlled by the operator:

```text
archive_command = '/controller/manager wal-archive %p'
archive_mode = 'on'
archive_timeout = '5min'
full_page_writes = 'on'
hot_standby = 'true'
port = '5432'
ssl = 'off'
wal_level = 'logical'
wal_log_hints = 'on'
```

Since the fixed parameters are added last, they can't be overridden by the
user via the YAML configuration. Those parameters are required for correct WAL
archiving and replication.

!!! Important
    The `parameters` value in the `Cluster` definition is used only during cluster
    creation. Changing it after cluster creation currently has no
    effect on the cluster.

### Replication settings

The `primary_conninfo` and `recovery_target_timeline` parameters are managed
automatically by the operator according to the state of the instance in
the cluster.

```text
primary_conninfo = 'host=cluster-example-rw user=postgres dbname=postgres'
recovery_target_timeline = 'latest'
```

## The `pg_hba` section

`pg_hba` is a list of PostgreSQL Host Based Authentication rules,
used to create the `pg_hba.conf` used by the pods.

Since the first matching rule is used for authentication, the `pg_hba.conf` file
generated by the operator can be seen as composed by three sections:

1. Fixed rules
2. User defined rules
3. Default rules

Fixed rules:

```text
local all all peer
```

Default rules:

```text
host all all all md5
host replication all all md5
```

The resulting `pg_hba.conf` will look like this:

```text
local all all peer
<user defined rules>
host all all all md5
host replication all all md5
```

!!! Important
    The `pg_hba` value in the `Cluster` definition is used only during cluster
    creation. Changing it after cluster creation currently has no
    effect on the cluster.

Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for [more information on `pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).
