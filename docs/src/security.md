# Security

Security for CloudNativePG
is analyzed at three different layers: code, container, and cluster.

!!! Warning
    In addition to the security tasks described here, you must
    perform regular InfoSec duties on your Kubernetes cluster. 
    Familiarize yourself with [Overview of Cloud Native Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/)
    in the Kubernetes documentation.

!!! Seealso "About the 4C's Security Model"
    See [The 4Câ€™s Security Model in Kubernetes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/4cs-security-model-kubernetes)
    blog article to get a better understanding and context of the approach EDB
    took with security in CloudNativePG.

## Code

CloudNativePG's source code undergoes systematic static analysis using the popular open-source linter for
Go, [GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), directly
integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This analysis includes
checks for security vulnerabilities. GolangCI-Lint can run multiple linters on
the same source code.

The following tools are used to identify security issues:

- **[Golang Security Checker](https://github.com/securego/gosec) (`gosec`):** A
  linter that scans the abstract syntax tree of the source code against a set
  of rules designed to detect known vulnerabilities, threats, and weaknesses,
  such as hard-coded credentials, integer overflows, and SQL injections.
  GolangCI-Lint runs `gosec` as part of its suite.

- **[govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck):** This
  tool runs in the CI/CD pipeline and reports known vulnerabilities affecting
  Go code or the compiler. If the operator is built with a version of the Go
  compiler containing a known vulnerability, `govulncheck` will detect it.

- **[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/):** Provided by GitHub, this tool scans
  for security issues and blocks any pull request with detected
  vulnerabilities. CodeQL is configured to review only Go code, excluding other
  languages in the repository such as Python or Bash.

- **[Snyk](https://snyk.io/):** Conducts nightly code scans in a scheduled job
  and generates weekly reports highlighting any new findings related to code
  security and licensing issues.

The CloudNativePG repository has the **Private vulnerability reporting** option
enabled in the [Security section](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/security).
This feature allows users to safely report security issues that require careful
handling before being publicly disclosed. If you discover any security bug,
use this medium to report it.

!!! Important
    A failure in the static code analysis phase of the CI/CD pipeline will
    block the entire delivery process of CloudNativePG. Every commit must pass all
    the linters defined by GolangCI-Lint.

## Container

Every container image in CloudNativePG is built via CI/CD
pipelines following every commit. These images include not only the operator's
image but also the operands' images, specifically for every supported
PostgreSQL version. During the CI/CD process, images undergo scanning with the
following tools:

- **[Dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle):** Ensures best practices
  in the container build process.
- **[Snyk](https://snyk.io/):** Detects security issues within the container
  and reports findings via the GitHub interface.

!!! Important
    All operand images are rebuilt daily by our pipelines to
    incorporate security updates at the base image and package level, providing
    **patch-level updates** for the container images distributed to the community.

### Guidelines and frameworks for container security

The following guidelines and frameworks have been considered for ensuring
container-level security:

- **["Container Image Creation and Deployment Guide"](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/devsecops/pdf/DevSecOps_Enterprise_Container_Image_Creation_and_Deployment_Guide_2.6-Public-Release.pdf):**
  Developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) of the United States
  Department of Defense (DoD).
- **["CIS Benchmark for Docker"](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/):**
  Developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).

!!! Seealso "About container-level security"
    For more information on the approach that EDB has taken regarding security
    at the container level in CloudNativePG, see the blog article
    ["Security and Containers in CloudNativePG"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/security-and-containers-cloud-native-postgresql).

## Cluster

Security at the cluster level takes into account all Kubernetes components that
form both the control plane and the nodes, as well as the applications that run in
the cluster, including PostgreSQL.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

The operator interacts with the Kubernetes API server using a dedicated service
account named `cnpg-manager`. This service account is typically installed in
the operator namespace, commonly `cnpg-system`. However, the namespace can vary
based on the deployment method (see [Deployments and `ClusterRole` resources](#deployments-and-clusterrole-resources).

In the same namespace, there's a binding between the `cnpg-manager` service
account and a role. The specific name and type of this role (either `Role` or
`ClusterRole`) also depend on the deployment method. This role defines the
necessary permissions required by the operator to function correctly. To learn
more about these roles, you can use the `kubectl describe clusterrole` or
`kubectl describe role` commands, depending on the deployment method.

!!! Important
    These permissions are exclusively reserved for the operator's service
    account to interact with the Kubernetes API server. They're not directly
    accessible by the users of the operator that interact only with `Cluster`,
    `Pooler`, `Backup`, `ScheduledBackup`, `ImageCatalog` and
    `ClusterImageCatalog` resources.

The following are some examples and, most importantly, the reasons why
CloudNativePG requires full or partial management of standard Kubernetes
namespaced or non-namespaced resources.

`configmaps`
: The operator needs to create and manage default config maps for
  the Prometheus exporter monitoring metrics.

`deployments`
: The operator needs to manage a PgBouncer connection pooler
  using a standard Kubernetes `Deployment` resource.

`jobs`
: The operator needs to handle jobs to manage different `Cluster` phases.

`persistentvolumeclaims`
: The volume where the `PGDATA` resides is the
  central element of a PostgreSQL `Cluster` resource. The operator needs
  to interact with the selected storage class to dynamically provision
  the requested volumes, based on the defined scheduling policies.

`pods`
: The operator needs to manage `Cluster` instances.

`secrets`
: Unless you provide certificates and passwords to your `Cluster`
  objects, the operator adopts the convention-over-configuration paradigm by
  self-provisioning random-generated passwords and TLS certificates, and by
  storing them in secrets.

`serviceaccounts`
: The operator needs to create a service account that
  enables the instance manager, which is the *PID 1* process of the container
  that controls the PostgreSQL server. This is needed to safely communicate with the
  Kubernetes API server to coordinate actions and continuously provide
  a reliable status of the `Cluster`.

`services`
: The operator needs to control network access to the PostgreSQL cluster
  or the connection pooler from applications. It also needs to properly manage
  failover/switchover operations in an automated way by assigning, for example,
  the correct endpoint of a service to the proper primary PostgreSQL instance.

`validatingwebhookconfigurations` and `mutatingwebhookconfigurations`
: The operator injects its self-signed webhook CA into both webhook
  configurations, which are needed to validate and mutate all the resources it
  manages. For more details, see the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).

`volumesnapshots`
: The operator needs to generate `VolumeSnapshots` objects to take
  backups of a PostgreSQL server. `VolumeSnapshots` are also read, to
  validate them before starting the restore process.

`nodes`
: The operator needs to get the labels for Affinity and AntiAffinity so it can
  decide in which nodes a pod can be scheduled. This is useful, for example, to
  prevent the replicas from being scheduled in the same node. It's especially
  important if nodes are in different availability zones. This
  permission is also used to determine whether a node is scheduled, preventing
  the creation of pods on unscheduled nodes, or triggering a switchover if
  the primary lives in an unscheduled node.

#### Deployments and `ClusterRole` resources

As mentioned previously, each deployment method can have variations in the namespace
location of the service account, as well as the names and types of role
bindings and respective roles.

##### Via Kubernetes manifest

When installing CloudNativePG using the Kubernetes manifest, permissions are
set to `ClusterRoleBinding` by default. You can inspect the permissions
required by the operator by running:

```sh
kubectl describe clusterrole cnpg-manager
```

##### Via OLM

From a security perspective, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides a
more flexible deployment method. It allows you to configure the operator to
watch either all namespaces or specific namespaces, enabling more granular
permission management.

!!! Info
   OLM allows you to deploy the operator in its own namespace and configure it
   to watch specific namespaces used for CloudNativePG clusters. This setup helps
   to contain permissions and restrict access more effectively.

#### Why are ClusterRole permissions needed?

The operator currently requires `ClusterRole` permissions to read `nodes` and
`ClusterImageCatalog` objects. All other permissions can be namespace-scoped (for example, `Role`) or
cluster-wide (for example, `ClusterRole`).

Even with these permissions, if someone gains access to the `ServiceAccount`,
they'll only have `get`, `list`, and `watch` permissions, which are limited
to viewing resources. However, if an unauthorized user gains access to the
`ServiceAccount`, it indicates a more significant security issue.

Therefore, it's crucial to prevent users from accessing the operator's
`ServiceAccount` and any other `ServiceAccount` with elevated permissions.

### Calls to the API server made by the instance manager

The instance manager, which is the entry point of the operand container, needs
to make some calls to the Kubernetes API server. These calls ensure that the status of
some resources is correctly updated and access the config maps and secrets
that are associated with that Postgres cluster. Such calls are performed through
a dedicated `ServiceAccount` created by the operator that shares the same
PostgreSQL `Cluster` resource name.

!!! Important
    The operand can access only a specific and limited subset of resources
    through the API server. A service account is the
    [recommended way to access the API server from a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/access-api-from-pod/).

For transparency, the permissions associated with the service account are defined in the
[roles.go](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/pkg/specs/roles.go)
file. For example, to retrieve the permissions of a generic `mypg` cluster in the
`myns` namespace, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get role -n myns mypg -o yaml
```

Then verify that the role is bound to the service account:

```bash
kubectl get rolebinding -n myns mypg -o yaml
```

!!! Important
    Remember that roles are limited to a given namespace.

The following is a quick summary of the permissions associated with the service
account for generic Kubernetes resources.

`configmaps`
: The instance manager can only read config maps that are related to the same
  cluster, such as custom monitoring queries.

`secrets`
: The instance manager can only read secrets that are related to the same
  cluster, namely: streaming replication user, application user, super user,
  LDAP authentication user, client CA, server CA, server certificate, backup
  credentials, and custom monitoring queries.

`events`
: The instance manager can create an event for the cluster, informing the
  API server about a particular aspect of the PostgreSQL instance lifecycle.

Here, instead, is the same summary for resources specific to
CloudNativePG.

`clusters`
: The instance manager requires read-only permissions, namely `get`, `list`, and
  `watch`, for its own `Cluster` resource.

`clusters/status`
: The instance manager requires to `update` and `patch` the status of its
  own `Cluster` resource.

`backups`
: The instance manager requires `get` and `list` permissions to read any
  `Backup` resource in the namespace. Additionally, it requires the `delete`
  permission to clean up the Kubernetes cluster by removing the `Backup` objects
  that don't have a counterpart in the object store, typically because of
  retention policies.

`backups/status`
: The instance manager requires to `update` and `patch` the status of any
  `Backup` resource in the namespace.

### Pod security policies

!!! Important
    Starting from Kubernetes v1.21, the use of `PodSecurityPolicy` was
    deprecated; as of Kubernetes v1.25, it was completely removed. Despite
    this deprecation, we acknowledge that the operator is currently undergoing
    testing in older and unsupported versions of Kubernetes. Therefore, this
    section is retained for those specific scenarios.

A [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)
is the Kubernetes way to define security rules and specifications that a pod needs to meet
to run in a cluster.
For InfoSec reasons, every Kubernetes platform must implement them.

CloudNativePG doesn't require privileged mode for containers execution.
The PostgreSQL containers run as the postgres system user. No component requires running as root.

Likewise, volumes access doesn't require privileged mode or root privileges.
Proper permissions must be assigned by the Kubernetes platform or administrators.
The PostgreSQL containers run with a read-only root filesystem, that is, no writable layer.

The operator explicitly sets the required security contexts.

### Restricting pod access using AppArmor

You can assign an
[AppArmor](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/) profile to
the `postgres`, `initdb`, `join`, `full-recovery`, and `bootstrap-controller` containers inside every `Cluster` pod using the
`container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io` annotation.

!!! Seealso "Example of cluster annotations"
```
	kind: Cluster
	metadata:
		name: cluster-apparmor
		annotations:
			container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/postgres: runtime/default
			container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/initdb: runtime/default
			container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/join: runtime/default
```

!!! Warning
    Using this kind of annotations can cause your cluster to stop working.
    If this happens, you can safely remove the annotation from the cluster.

The AppArmor configuration must be at Kubernetes node level, meaning that the
underlying operating system must have this option enabled and properly
configured. If not, and the annotations were added at the
`Cluster` creation time, pods aren't created. On the other hand, if you
add the annotations after the `Cluster` was created, the pods in the cluster can't
start, and you see an error like this:

```
metadata.annotations[container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/postgres]: Forbidden: may not add AppArmor annotations]
```

In such cases, contact your Kubernetes administrators and ask for the
correct AppArmor profile to use.

### Network policies

The pods created by the `Cluster` resource can be controlled by Kubernetes
[network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
to enable or disable inbound and outbound network access at IP and TCP level.
For more information, see [Networking](networking.md).

!!! Important
    The operator needs to communicate to each instance on TCP port 8000
    to get information about the status of the PostgreSQL server. 
    Make sure you keep this in mind if you add any network policy,
    and refer to [Exposed ports](#exposed-ports) for a list of ports used by
    CloudNativePG for finer control.

Network policies are beyond the scope of this documentation.
See [Network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
in the Kubernetes documentation for more information.

#### Exposed ports

CloudNativePG exposes ports at operator, instance manager, and operand
levels, as shown in the table.

| System           | Port number | Exposing            | Name             | TLS      | Authentication |
|:-----------------|:------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|:---------|:---------------|
| operator         | 9443        | webhook server      | `webhook-server` | Yes      | Yes            |
| operator         | 8080        | metrics             | `metrics`        | No       | No             |
| instance manager | 9187        | metrics             | `metrics`        | Optional | No             |
| instance manager | 8000        | status              | `status`         | Yes      | No             |
| operand          | 5432        | PostgreSQL instance | `postgresql`     | Optional | Yes            |

### PostgreSQL

The current implementation of CloudNativePG creates
passwords and `.pgpass` files for the database owner. It creates passwords and `pgpass` files
for the postgres superuser only if you set `enableSuperuserAccess` to `true`.

!!! Warning
    `enableSuperuserAccess` is set to `false` by default to improve the
    security-by-default posture of the operator. This setting fosters a microservice approach
    where changes to PostgreSQL are performed in a declarative way through the
    `spec` of the `Cluster` resource. At the same time, it provides developers with full powers
    inside the database through the database owner user.

As far as password encryption is concerned, CloudNativePG follows
the default behavior of PostgreSQL: starting with PostgreSQL 14,
`password_encryption` is by default set to `scram-sha-256`. In earlier
versions, it's set to `md5`.

!!! Important
    See [Password authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-password.html)
    in the PostgreSQL documentation for details.

!!! Note
    The operator supports toggling the `enableSuperuserAccess` option. When you
    disable it on a running cluster, the operator ignores the content of the secret,
    removes it (if previously generated by the operator), and sets the password of the
    `postgres` user to `NULL`. This in effect disables remote access through password authentication.

See [Secrets](applications.md#secrets) for more information.

You can use those files to configure application access to the database.

By default, every replica is configured to connect in *physical
async streaming replication* with the current primary instance, with a special
user called streaming_replica. The connection between nodes is encrypted,
and authentication is by way of TLS client certificates. (See
[Client TLS/SSL connections](ssl_connections.md#"Client TLS/SSL connections") 
for details.) By default, the operator requires TLS v1.3 connections.

Currently, the operator allows administrators to add `pg_hba.conf` lines directly in the manifest
as part of the `pg_hba` section of the `postgresql` configuration. The lines defined in the
manifest are added to a default `pg_hba.conf`.

For details on how `pg_hba.conf` is managed by the operator, see
[PostgreSQL configuration](postgresql_conf.md#the-pg_hba-section).

The administrator can also customize the content of the `pg_ident.conf` file that by default
only maps the local postgres user to the postgres user in the database.

For further detail on how `pg_ident.conf` is managed by the operator, see the
["PostgreSQL Configuration" page](postgresql_conf.md#the-pg_ident-section) of the documentation.

!!! Important
    Examples assume that the Kubernetes cluster runs in a private and secure network.

### Storage

CloudNativePG delegates encryption at rest to the underlying storage class. For
data protection in production environments, we strongly recommend that you choose
a storage class that supports encryption at rest.
